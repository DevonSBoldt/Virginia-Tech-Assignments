" what they were doing and I knew it would work. I asked to write this 
foreword so that I could explain why.
Simply put, this book tells you how to program in a way that you can follow. You wouldn't 
think that that would be a hard thing to do, but it is. Why? For one thing, not all 
programming books are written by programmers. Many are compiled by language 
designers, or the journalists who work with them to promote their creations. Those books 
tell you how to 
talk
 in a programming language—which is certainly important, but that i
s
only a small part of what a programmer does
.
What does a programmer do besides talk in programming language? Well, that is a deeper 
issue. Most programmers would have trouble explaining what they do. Programming is a 
job filled with details, and keeping track of those details requires focus. Hours drift by and 
the code appears. You look up and there are all of those statements. If you don't think 
carefully, you might think that programming is just typing statements in a programming 
language. You would be wrong, of course, but you wouldn't be able to tell by looking 
around the programming section of the bookstore.
In 
The Pragmatic Programmer
 Dave and Andy tell us how to program in a way that w
e
can follow. How did they get so smart? Aren't they just as focused on details as othe
r
programmers? The answer is that they paid attention to what they were doing while the
y
were doing it—and then they tried to do it better
.
Imagine that you are sitting in a meeting. Maybe you are thinking that the meeting could go 
on forever and that you would rather be programming. Dave and Andy would be thinking 
about why they were having the meeting, and wondering if there is something else they 
could do that would take the place of the meeting, and deciding if that something could be 
automated so that the work of the meeting just happens in the future. Then they would do 
it.
That is just the way Dave and Andy think. That meeting wasn't something keeping them 
from programming. It 
was
 programming. And it was programming that could be improved. I 
know they think this way because it is tip number two: Think About Your Work.
 So imagine that these guys are thinking this way for a few years. Pretty soon they would 
have a collection of solutions. Now imagine them using their solutions in their work for a 
few more years, and discarding the ones that are too hard or don't always produce results. 
Well, that approach just about defines 
pragmatic.
 Now imagine them taking a year or two 
more to write their solutions down. You might think, 
That information would be a gold 
mine.
 And you would be right.
The authors tell us how they program. And they tell us in a way that we can follow. But 
there is more to this second statement than you might think. Let me explain.
The authors have been careful to avoid proposing a theory of software development. This 
is fortunate, because if they had they would be obliged to warp each chapter to defend 
their theory. Such warping is the tradition in, say, the physical sciences, where theories 
eventually become laws or are quietly discarded. Programming on the other hand has few 
(if any) laws. So programming advice shaped around wanna-be laws may sound good in 
writing, but it fails to satisfy in practice. This is what goes wrong with so many methodology 
books.
I've studied this problem for a dozen years and found the most promise in a device called a 
pattern language.
 In short, a 
pattern
 is a solution, and a pattern language is a system of 
solutions that reinforce each other. A whole community has formed around the search for 
these systems.
This book is more than a collection of tips. It is a pattern language in sheep's clothing. I say 
that because each tip is drawn from experience, told as concrete advice, and related to 
others to form a system. These are the characteristics that allow us to learn and follow a 
pattern language. They work the same way here.
You can follow the advice in this book because it is concrete. You won't find vague 
abstractions. Dave and Andy write directly for you, as if each tip was a vital strategy for 
energizing your programming career. They make it simple, they tell a story, they use a light 
touch, and then they follow that up with answers to questions that will come up when you 
try.
And there is more. After you read ten or fifteen tips you will begin to see an extra 
dimension to the work. We sometimes call it 
QWAN,
 short for the 
quality without a name.
The book has a philosophy that will ooze into your consciousness and mix with your own. It 
doesn't preach. It just tells what works. But in the telling more comes through. That's the 
beauty of the book: It embodies its philosophy, and it does so unpretentiously.
 So here it is: an easy to read—and use—book about the whole practice of programming
.
I've gone on and on about why it works. You probably only care that it does work. It does

Preface
This book will help you become a better programmer.
It doesn't matter whether you are a lone developer, a member of a large project team, or 
a
consultant working with many clients at once. This book will help you, as an individual, t
o
do better work. This book isn't theoretical—we concentrate on practical topics, on usin
g
your experience to make more informed decisions. The word
 
pragmatic
 comes from the 
Latin 
pragmaticus
—
""skilled in business""—which itself is derived from the Gree
k
, meaning ""to do."" This is a book about doing.
Programming is a craft. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a computer to do what you 
want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As a programmer, you are part listener, part 
advisor, part interpreter, and part dictator. You try to capture elusive requirements and find 
a way of expressing them so that a mere machine can do them justice. You try to 
document your work so that others can understand it, and you try to engineer your work so 
that others can build on it. What's more, you try to do all this against the relentless ticking 
of the project clock. You work small miracles every day.
It's a difficult job.
There are many people offering you help. Tool vendors tout the miracles their products 
perform. Methodology gurus promise that their techniques guarantee results. Everyone 
claims that their programming language is the best, and every operating system is the 
answer to all conceivable ills.
Of course, none of this is true. There are no easy answers. There is no such thing as a 
best
 solution, be it a tool, a language, or an operating system. There can only be systems 
that are more appropriate in a particular set","[0.033633832, 0.022863448, -0.02202665, -0.015332277, 0.04710356, -0.040895067, -0.022202108, 0.043162517, -0.04343245, 0.01985368, 0.07952269,

", or an operating system. There can only be systems 
that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances.
This is where pragmatism comes in. You shouldn't be wedded to any particular technology, 
but have a broad enough background and experience base to allow you to choose good 
solutions in particular situations. Your background stems from an understanding of the 
basic principles of computer science, and your experience comes from a wide range of 
practical projects. Theory and practice combine to make you strong.
You adjust your approach to suit the current circumstances and environment. You judge 
 the relative importance of all the factors affecting a project and use your experience to 
produce appropriate solutions. And you do this continuously as the work progresses. 
Pragmatic Programmers get the job done, and do it well.

Who Should Read This Book?
This book is aimed at people who want to become more effective and more productive 
programmers. Perhaps you feel frustrated that you don't seem to be achieving your 
potential. Perhaps you look at colleagues who seem to be using tools to make themselves 
more productive than you. Maybe your current job uses older technologies, and you want 
to know how newer ideas can be applied to what you do.
We don't pretend to have all (or even most) of the answers, nor are all of our ideas 
applicable in all situations. All we can say is that if you follow our approach, you'll gain 
experience rapidly, your productivity will increase, and you'll have a better understanding of 
the entire development process. And you'll write better software.

What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?
Each developer is unique, with individual strengths and weaknesses, preferences and 
dislikes. Over time, each will craft his or her own personal environment. That environment 
will reflect the programmer's individuality just as forcefully as his or her hobbies, clothing, 
or haircut. However, if you're a Pragmatic Programmer, you'll share many of the following 
characteristics:
Early adopter/fast adapter. 
 
 You have an instinct for technologies an
d
techniques, and you love trying things out. When given something new, you can 
grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of your knowledge. Your confidence is 
born of experience.
Inquisitive. 
 
 You tend to ask questions.
 
That's neat—how did you do that? Di
d
you have problems with that library? What's this BeOS I've heard about? Ho
w
are symbolic links implemented
?
 You are a pack rat for little facts, each of which 
may affect some decision years from now.
Critical thinker. 
 
 You rarely take things as given without first getting the facts
.
When colleagues say ""because that's the way it's done,"" or a vendor promises the 
solution to all your problems, you smell a challenge.
Realistic. 
 
 You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face
.
This realism gives you a good feel for how difficult things are, and how long things 
will take. Understanding for yourself that a process 
should
 be difficult or 
will
 take a 
while to complete gives you the stamina to keep at it.
Jack of all trades. 
 
 You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologie
s
and environments, and you work to keep abreast of new developments. Although 
your current job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move 
on to new areas and new challenges.
We've left the most basic characteristics until last. All Pragmatic Programmers share them. 
They're basic enough to state as tips:
Tip 1
 Care About Your Craft
We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well.
Tip 2
Think! About Your Work
In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer, we're challenging you to think about what you'r
e
doing while you're doing it. This isn't a one-time audit of current practices—it's an ongoin
g
critical appraisal of every decision you make, every day, and on every development. Neve
r
run on auto-pilot. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time. The old IB
M
corporate motto, THINK!, is the Pragmatic Programmer's mantra
.
If this sounds like hard work to you, then you're exhibiting the 
realistic
 characteristic. Thi
s
is going to take up some of your valuable time—time that is probably already unde
r
tremendous pressure. The reward is a more active involvement with a job you love, 
a
feeling of mastery over an increasing range of subjects, and pleasure in a feeling o
f
continuous improvement. Over the long term, your time investment will be repaid as yo
u
and your team become more efficient, write code that's easier to maintain, and spend les
s
time in meetings

Individual Pragmatists, Large Teams
Some people feel that there is no room for individuality on large teams or complex projects. 
""Software construction is an engineering discipline,"" they say, ""that breaks down if 
individual team members make decisions for themselves.""
We disagree.
The construction of software 
should
 be an engineering discipline. However, this doesn't 
preclude individual craftsmanship. Think about the large cathedrals built in Europe during 
the Middle Ages. Each took thousands of person-years of effort, spread over many 
decades. Lessons learned were passed down to the next set of builders, who advanced 
the state of structural engineering with their accomplishments. But the carpenters, 
stonecutters, carvers, and glass workers were all craftspeople, interpreting the engineering 
requirements to produce a whole that transcended the purely mechanical side of the 
construction. It was their belief in their individual contributions that sustained the projects:
We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.
—
Quarry worker's creed
Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and 
craftsmanship. This is particularly true given the current state of software engineering. One 
hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by 
medieval cathedral builders seem to today's civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will 
still be honored.

It's a Continuous Process
A tourist visiting England's Eton College asked the gardener how he got the lawns so 
perfect. ""That's easy,"" he replied, ""You just brush off the dew every morning, mow 
them every other day, and roll them once a week.""
""Is that all?"" asked the tourist.
""Absolutely,"" replied the gardener. ""Do that for 500 years and you'll have a nice lawn, 
too.""
Great lawns need small amounts of daily care, and so do great programmers. 
Management consultants like to drop the word 
kaizen

" to drop the word 
kaizen
 in conversations. ""Kaizen"" is a 
Japanese term that captures the concept of continuously making many small 
improvements. It was considered to be one of the main reasons for the dramatic gains in 
productivity and quality in Japanese manufacturing and was widely copied throughout the 
world. Kaizen applies to individuals, too. Every day, work to refine the skills you have and 
to add new tools to your repertoire. Unlike the Eton lawns, you'll start seeing results in a 
matter of days. Over the years, you'll be amazed at how your experience has blossomed 
and your skills have grown.

How the Book Is Organized
This book is written as a collection of short sections. Each section is self-contained, an
d
addresses a particular topic. You'll find numerous cross references, which help put eac
h
topic in context. Feel free to read the sections in any order—this isn't a book you need t
o
read front-to-back
.
Occasionally you'll come across a box labeled 
Tip nn
 (such as Tip 1, ""Care About You
r
Craft"" on page xix). As well as emphasizing points in the text, we feel the tips have a life o
f
their own—we live by them daily. You'll find a summary of all the tips on a pull-out car
d
inside the back cover
.
Appendix A
 contains a set of resources: the book's bibliography, a list of URLs to We
b
resources, and a list of recommended periodicals, books, and professional organizations
.
Throughout the book you'll find references to the bibliography and to the list of URLs—suc
h
as 
[
KP99
] and [URL 18], respectively.
We've included exercises and challenges where appropriate. Exercises normally have 
relatively straightforward answers, while the challenges are more open-ended. To give you 
an idea of our thinking, we've included our answers to the exercises in 
Appendix B
, but 
very few have a single 
correct
 solution. The challenges might form the basis of group 
discussions or essay work in advanced programming courses.

What's in a Name?
""When I use a word,"" Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ""it means jus
t
what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.
""
Lewis Carroll,
 
Through the Looking-Glass
Scattered throughout the book you'll find various bits of jargon—either perfectly goo
d
English words that have been corrupted to mean something technical, or horrendou
s
made-up words that have been assigned meanings by computer scientists with a grudg
e
against the language. The first time we use each of these jargon words, we try to define it
,
or at least give a hint to its meaning. However, we're sure that some have fallen throug
h
the cracks, and others, such as
 
object
 and 
relational database,
 are in common enough 
usage that adding a definition would be boring. If you do come across a term you haven't 
seen before, please don't just skip over it. Take time to look it up, perhaps on the Web, or 
maybe in a computer science textbook. And, if you get a chance, drop us an e-mail and 
complain, so we can add a definition to the next edition.
Having said all this, we decided to get revenge against the computer scientists
.
Sometimes, there are perfectly good jargon words for concepts, words that we've decide
d
to ignore. Why? Because the existing jargon is normally restricted to a particular proble
m
domain, or to a particular phase of development. However, one of the basic philosophies o
f
this book is that most of the techniques we're recommending are universal: modularit
y
applies to code, designs, documentation, and team organization, for instance. When w
e
wanted to use the conventional jargon word in a broader context, it got confusing—w
e
couldn't seem to overcome the baggage the original term brought with it. When thi
s
happened, we contributed to the decline of the language by inventing our own terms
.

Acknowledgments
When we started writing this book, we had no idea how much of a team effort it would end 
up being.
Addison-Wesley has been brilliant, taking a couple of wet-behind-the-ears hackers and 
walking us through the whole book-production process, from idea to camera-ready copy. 
Many thanks to John Wait and Meera Ravindiran for their initial support, Mike Hendrickson, 
our enthusiastic editor (and a mean cover designer!), Lorraine Ferrier and John Fuller for 
their help with production, and the indefatigable Julie DeBaggis for keeping us all together.
Then there were the reviewers: Greg Andress, Mark Cheers, Chris Cleeland, Alistair 
Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Martin Fowler, Thanh T. Giang, Robert L. Glass, Scott 
Henninger, Michael Hunter, Brian Kirby, John Lakos, Pete McBreen, Carey P. Morris, 
Jared Richardson, Kevin Ruland, Eric Starr, Eric Vought, Chris Van Wyk, and Deborra 
Zukowski. Without their careful comments and valuable insights, this book would be less 
readable, less accurate, and twice as long. Thank you all for your time and wisdom.
The second printing of this book benefited greatly from the eagle eyes of our readers. 
Many thanks to Brian Blank, Paul Boal, Tom Ekberg, Brent Fulgham, Louis Paul Hebert, 
Henk-Jan Olde Loohuis, Alan Lund, Gareth McCaughan, Yoshiki Shibata, and Volker 
Wurst, both for finding the mistakes and for having the grace to point them out gently.
Over the years, we have worked with a large number of progressive clients, where we 
gained and refined the experience we write about here. Recently, we've been fortunate to 
work with Peter Gehrke on several large projects. His support and enthusiasm for our 
techniques are much appreciated.
This book was produced using LATEX, pic, Perl, dvips, ghostview, ispell, GNU make, CVS,

Chapter 1. A Pragmatic Philosoph
y
What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers? We feel it's an attitude, a style, a philosophy 
of approaching problems and their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem, 
always trying to place it in its larger context, always trying to be aware of the bigger picture. 
After all, without this larger context, how can you be pragmatic? How can you make 
intelligent compromises and informed decisions?
Another key to their success is that they take responsibility for everything they do, which 
we discuss in 
The Cat Ate My Source Code.
 Being responsible, Pragmatic Programmers 
won't sit idly by and watch their projects fall apart through neglect. In 
Software Entropy,
 we 
tell you how to keep your projects pristine.
Most people find change difficult to accept, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes 
because of plain old inertia. In 
Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs,
 we look at a strategy for 
instigating change and (in the interests of balance) present the cautionary tale of an 
amphibian that ignored the dangers of gradual change.
One of the benefits of understanding the context in which you work is that it becomes 
easier to know just how good your software has to be. Sometimes near-perfection is the 
only option, but often there are trade-offs involved. We explore this in 
Good-Enough 
Software.
Of course, you need to have a broad base of knowledge and experience to pull all of this 
off. Learning is a continuous and ongoing process. In 
Your Knowledge Portfolio,
 we 
discuss some strategies for keeping the momentum up.
Finally, none of us works in a vacuum. We all spend a large amount of time interacting with 
others. 
Communicate!
 lists ways we can do this better.
Pragmatic programming stems from a philosophy of pragmatic thinking. This chapter sets 
the basis for that philosophy.

The Cat Ate My Source Code
The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak.
J. B. Bossuet, 
Politics from Holy Writ,
 1709
One of the cornerstones of the pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking responsibility fo
r
yourself and your actions in terms of your career advancement, your project, and you
r
day-to-day work. A Pragmatic Programmer takes charge of his or her own career, and isn'
t
afraid to admit ignorance or error. It's not the most pleasant aspect of programming, to b
e
sure, but it will happen—even on the best of projects. Despite thorough testing, goo
d
documentation, and solid automation, things go wrong. Deliveries are late. Unforesee
n
technical problems come up
.
These things happen, and we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. Thi
s
means being honest and direct. We can be proud of our abilities, but we must be hones
t
about our shortcomings—our ignorance as well as our mistakes
.
Take Responsibility
Responsibility is something you actively agree to. You make a commitment to ensure that 
something is done right, but you don't necessarily have direct control over every aspect of 
it. In addition to doing your own personal best, you must analyze the situation for risks that 
are beyond your control. You have the right 
not
 to take on a responsibility for an impossible 
situation, or one in which the risks are too great. You'll have to make the call based on your 
own ethics and judgment.
When you 
do
 accept the responsibility for an outcome, you should expect to be held 
accountable for it. When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it 
honestly and try to offer options.
Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don't blame all the 
problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any 
and all of these may play a role, but it is up to 
you
 to provide solutions, not excuses.
If there was a risk that the vendor wouldn't come through for you, then you should hav
e
had a contingency plan. If the disk crashes—taking all of your source code with it—and yo
u
 don't have a backup, it's your fault. Telling your boss
 
""the cat ate my source code""
 just 
won't cut it.
Tip 3
Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses
Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can't be done, is late, or is 
broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. 
Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How's it going to sound to your boss?
Run through the conversation in your mind. What is the other person likely to say? Wil
l
they ask, ""Have you tried this…"" or ""Didn't you consider that?"" How will you respond
?
Before you go and tell them the bad news, is there anything else you can try? Sometimes
,
you just
 
know
 what they are going to say, so save them the trouble.
Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what 
can
 be done 
to salvage the situation. Does code have to be thrown out? Educate them on the value of 
refactoring (see 
Refactoring
). Do you need to spend time prototyping to determine the best 
way to proceed (see 
Prototypes and Post-it Notes
)? Do you need to introduce better 
testing (see 
Code That's Easy to Test
 and 
Ruthless Testing
) or automation (see 
Ubiquitous Automation
) to prevent it from happening again? Perhaps you need additional 
resources. Don't be afraid to ask, or to admit that you need help.
Try to flush out the lame excuses before voicing them aloud. If you must, tell your cat first
.
After all, if little Tiddles is going to take the blame…

Software Entropy
While software development is immune from almost all physical laws, 
entropy
 hits us hard. 
Entropy
 is a term from physics that refers to the amount of ""disorder"" in a system. 
Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that the entropy in the universe 
tends toward a maximum. When disorder increases in software, programmers call it 
""software rot.""
There are many factors that can contribute to software rot. The most important one seems 
to be the psychology, or culture, at work on a project. Even if you are a team of one, your 
project's psychology can be a very delicate thing. Despite the best laid plans and the best 
people, a project can still experience ruin and decay during its lifetime. Yet there are other 
projects that, despite enormous difficulties and constant setbacks, successfully fight 
nature's tendency toward disorder and manage to come out pretty well.
What makes the difference?
In inner cities, some buildings are beautiful and clean, while others are rotting hulks. Why? 
Researchers in the field of crime and urban decay discovered a fascinating trigger 
mechanism, one that very quickly turns a clean, intact, inhabited building into a smashed 
and abandoned derelict [
WK82
].
A broken window.
One broken window, left unrepaired for any substantial length of time, instills in th
e
inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment—a sense that the powers that be don'
t
care about the building. So another window gets broken. People start littering. Graffit
i
appears. Serious structural damage begins. In a relatively short space of time, the buildin
g
becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it, and the sense of abandonmen
t
becomes reality
.
The ""Broken Window Theory"" has inspired police departments in New York and other 
major cities to crack down on the small stuff in order to keep out the big stuff. It works: 
keeping on top of broken windows, graffiti, and other small infractions has reduced the 
serious crime level.
Tip 4
 Don't Live with Broken Windows
Don't leave ""broken windows"" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix 
each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then 
board it up.
 Perhaps you can comment out the offending code, or display a ""Not 
Implemented"" message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take 
some
 action to prevent 
further damage and to show that you're on top of the situation.
We've seen clean, functional systems deteriorate pretty quickly once windows start 
breaking. There are other factors that can contribute to software rot, and we'll touch on 
some of them elsewhere, but neglect 
accelerates
 the rot faster than any other factor.
You may be thinking that no one has the time to go around cleaning up all the broken glass 
of a project. If you continue to think like that, then you'd better plan on getting a dumpster, 
or moving to another neighborhood. Don't let entropy win.
Putting Out Fires
By contrast, there's the story of an obscenely rich acquaintance of Andy's. His house was 
immaculate, beautiful, loaded with priceless antiques, 
objets d'art,
 and so on. One day, 
a
tapestry that was hanging a little too close to his living room fireplace caught on fire. Th
e
fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged thei
r
big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire raging—to roll out a ma
t
between the front door and the source of the fire
.
They didn't want to mess up the carpet.
A pretty extreme case, to be sure, but that's the way it must be with software. One broke
n
window—a badly designed piece of code, a poor management decision that the team mus
t
live with for the duration of the project— is all it takes to start the decline. If you fin
d
yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it's all too easy to slip int
o
the mindset of ""All the rest of this code is crap, I'll just follow suit."" It doesn't matter if th
e
project has been fine up to this point. In the original experiment leading to the ""Broke
n
Window Theory,"" an abandoned car sat for a week untouched. But once a single windo
w
was broken, the car was stripped and turned upside down within
 
hours.
 By the same token, if you find yourself on a team and a project where the code is pristinel
y
beautiful—cleanly written, well designed, and elegant—you will likely take extra specia
l
care not to mess it up, just like the firefighters. Even if there's a fire raging (deadline
,
release date, trade show demo, etc.),
 
you
 don't want to be the first one to make a mess.

Challenges
Help strengthen your team by surveying your computing ""neighborhood."" Choose 
two or three ""broken windows"" and discuss with your colleagues what the problems 
are and what could be done to fix them.
Can you tell when a window first gets broken? What is your reaction? If it was the 
result of someone else's decision, or a management edict, what can you do about 
it?

Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
The three soldiers returning home from war were hungry. When they saw the villag
e
ahead their spirits lifted—they were sure the villagers would give them a meal. Bu
t
when they got there, they found the doors locked and the windows closed. After man
y
years of war, the villagers were short of food, and hoarded what they had
.
Undeterred, the soldiers boiled a pot of water and carefully placed three stones into it. 
The amazed villagers came out to watch.
""This is stone soup,"" the soldiers explained. ""Is that all you put in it?"" asked th
e
villagers. ""Absolutely—although some say it tastes even better with a few carrots…."" 
A
villager ran off, returning in no time with a basket of carrots from his hoard
.
A couple of minutes later, the villagers again asked ""Is that it?""
""Well,"" said the soldiers, ""a couple of potatoes give it body."" Off ran another villager.
Over the next hour, the soldiers listed more ingredients that would enhance the soup: 
beef, leeks, salt, and herbs. Each time a different villager would run off to raid their 
personal stores.
Eventually they had produced a large pot of steaming soup. The soldiers removed the 
stones, and","[0.005938781, 0.02839492, -0.019957483, 0.00842155, 0.02130811, -0.019639688, 0.004504734, -0.024486052, -0.02289708, 0.029809106, 0.09756285, -0.04242554, -0.044936117, -0.00074334076,

stones, and they sat down with the entire village to enjoy the first square meal any of 
them had eaten in months.
There are a couple of morals in the stone soup story. The villagers are tricked by th
e
soldiers, who use the villagers' curiosity to get food from them. But more importantly, th
e
soldiers act as a catalyst, bringing the village together so they can jointly produc
e
something that they couldn't have done by themselves—a synergistic result. Eventuall
y
everyone wins
.
Every now and then, you might want to emulate the soldiers.
You may be in a situation where you know exactly what needs doing and how to do it. Th
e
entire system just appears before your eyes—you know it's right. But ask permission t
o
tackle the whole thing and you'll be met with delays and blank stares. People will for
m
 committees, budgets will need approval, and things will get complicated. Everyone wil
l
guard their own resources. Sometimes this is called ""start-up fatigue.
""
It's time to bring out the stones. Work out what you 
can
 reasonably ask for. Develop it well. 
Once you've got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say ""of course, it 
would
 b
e
better if we added…."" Pretend it's not important. Sit back and wait for them to start askin
g
you to add the functionality you originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoin
g
success. Show them a glimpse of the future and you'll get them to rally around
.

 While doing this, you may be comforted by the line attributed to Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper: ""It'
s
easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.""
Tip 5
Be a Catalyst for Change
The Villagers' Side
On the other hand, the stone soup story is also about gentle and gradual deception. It's 
about focusing too tightly. The villagers think about the stones and forget about the rest of 
the world. We all fall for it, every day. Things just creep up on us.
We've all seen the symptoms. Projects slowly and inexorably get totally out of hand. Most 
software disasters start out too small to notice, and most project overruns happen a day at 
a time. Systems drift from their specifications feature by feature, while patch after patch 
gets added to a piece of code until there's nothing of the original left. It's often the 
accumulation of small things that breaks morale and teams.
Tip 6
Remember the Big Picture
 We've never tried this—honest. But they say that if you take a frog and drop it into boilin
g
water, it will jump straight back out again. However, if you place the frog in a pan of col
d
water, then gradually heat it, the frog won't notice the slow increase in temperature and wil
l
stay put until cooked
.
Note that the frog's problem is different from the broken windows issue discussed in 
Section 2
. In the Broken Window Theory, people lose the will to fight entropy because they 
perceive that no one else cares. The frog just doesn't notice the change.
Don't be like the frog. Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what's happening 
around you, not just what you personally are doing.

While reviewing a draft of this book, John Lakos raised the following issue: The 
soldiers progressively deceive the villagers, but the change they catalyze does 
them all good. However, by progressively deceiving the frog, you're doing it harm. 
Can you determine whether you're making stone soup or frog soup when you try to 
catalyze change? Is the decision subjective or objective?

Good-Enough Software
Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
King Lear

There's an old(ish) joke about a U.S. company that places an order for 100,000 integrated 
circuits with a Japanese manufacturer. Part of the specification was the defect rate: one 
chip in 10,000. A few weeks later the order arrived: one large box containing thousands of 
ICs, and a small one containing just ten. Attached to the small box was a label that read: 
""These are the faulty ones.""
If only we really had this kind of control over quality. But the real world just won't let us 
produce much that's truly perfect, particularly not bug-free software. Time, technology, and 
temperament all conspire against us.
However, this doesn't have to be frustrating. As Ed Yourdon described in an article in 
IEEE 
Software
 [
You95
], you can discipline yourself to write software that's good enough—goo
d
enough for your users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind. You'll find tha
t
you are more productive and your users are happier. And you may well find that you
r
programs are actually better for their shorter incubation
.
Before we go any further, we need to qualify what we're about to say. The phrase ""good 
enough"" does not imply sloppy or poorly produced code. All systems must meet their 
users' requirements to be successful. We are simply advocating that users be given an 
opportunity to participate in the process of deciding when what you've produced is good 
enough.
Involve Your Users in the Trade-Off
Normally you're writing software for other people. Often you'll remember to get 
requirements from them.
[2]
 But how often do you ask them
 
how good
 they want their 
software to be? Sometimes there'll be no choice. If you're working on pacemakers, the 
space shuttle, or a low-level library that will be widely disseminated, the requirements will 
be more stringent and your options more limited. However, if you're working on a brand 
new product, you'll have different constraints. The marketing people will have promises to 
keep, the eventual end users may have made plans based on a delivery schedule, and 
 your company will certainly have cash-flow constraints. It would be unprofessional to ignore 
these users' requirements simply to add new features to the program, or to polish up the 
code just one more time. We're not advocating panic: it is equally unprofessional to 
promise impossible time scales and to cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline.
[2]
 That was supposed to be a joke
!
The scope and quality of the system you produce should be specified as part of that 
system's requirements.
Tip 7
Make Quality a Requirements Issue
Often you'll be in situations where trade-offs are involved. Surprisingly, many users would 
rather use software with some rough edges 
today
 than wait a year for the multimedia 
version.

 than wait a year for the multimedia 
version. Many IT departments with tight budgets would agree. Great software today is 
often preferable to perfect software tomorrow. If you give your users something to play with 
early, their feedback will often lead you to a better eventual solution (see 
Tracer Bullets
).
Know When to Stop
In some ways, programming is like painting. You start with a blank canvas and certain 
basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art, and craft to determine what to 
do with them. You sketch out an overall shape, paint the underlying environment, then fill in 
the details. You constantly step back with a critical eye to view what you've done. Every 
now and then you'll throw a canvas away and start again.
But artists will tell you that all the hard work is ruined if you don't know when to stop. If you 
add layer upon layer, detail over detail, 
the painting becomes lost in the paint.
Don't spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and over-refinement. Move on, 
and let your code stand in its own right for a while. It may not be perfect. Don't worry: it 
could never be perfect. (In 
Chapter 6
, we'll discuss philosophies for developing code in an 
imperfect world.)

The Requirements Pit

Great Expectations
Challenges
Look at the manufacturers of the software tools and operating systems that you 
use. Can you find any evidence that these companies are comfortable shipping 
software they know is not perfect? As a user, would you rather (1) wait for them to 
get all the bugs out, (2) have complex software and accept some bugs, or (3) opt 
for simpler software with fewer defects?
Consider the effect of modularization on the delivery of software. Will it take more 
or less time to get a monolithic block of software to the required quality compared 
with a system designed in modules? Can you find commercial examples?

Your Knowledge Portfolio
An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.
Benjamin Franklin
Ah, good old Ben Franklin—never at a loss for a pithy homily. Why, if we could just be earl
y
to bed and early to rise, we'd be great programmers—right? The early bird might get th
e
worm, but what happens to the early worm
?
In this case, though, Ben really hit the nail on the head. Your knowledge and experience 
are your most important professional assets.
Unfortunately, they're 
expiring assets.
[3]
 Your knowledge becomes out of date as ne
w
techniques, languages, and environments are developed. Changing market forces may 
render your experience obsolete or irrelevant. Given the speed at which Web-years fly by, 
this can happen pretty quickly.
[3]
 An
 
expiring asset
 is something whose value diminishes over time. Examples include a warehouse full 
of bananas and a ticket to a ball game.
As the value of your knowledge declines, so does your value to your company or client. We
want to prevent this from ever happening.
Your Knowledge Portfolio
We like to think of all the facts programmers know about computing, the application 
domains they work in, and all their experience as their 
Knowledge Portfolios.
 Managing a 
knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:
Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit
.
1
.
Diversification is the key to long-term success.
2
.
Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, 
high-reward investments.
3
.
Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
4
.
 Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.
5
.
To be successful in your career, you must manage your knowledge portfolio using these 
same guidelines.
Building Your Portfolio
Invest regularly. 
 
 Just as in financial investing, you must invest in you
r
knowledge portfolio 
regularly.
 Even if it's just a small amount, the habit itself is as 
important as the sums. A few sample goals are listed in the next section.
Diversify. 
 
 The more
 
different
 things you know, the more valuable you are. As 
a
baseline, you need to know the ins and outs of the particular technology you ar
e
working with currently. But don't stop there. The face of computing change
s
rapidly—hot technology today may well be close to useless (or at least not i
n
demand) tomorrow. The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better yo
u
will be able to adjust to change
.
Manage risk. 
 
 Technology exists along a spectrum from risky, potentiall
y
high-reward to low-risk, low-reward standards. It's not a good idea to invest all of 
your money in high-risk stocks that might collapse suddenly, nor should you invest 
all of it conservatively and miss out on possible opportunities. Don't put all your 
technical eggs in one basket.
Buy low, sell high. 
 
 Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popula
r
can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as 
rewarding. Learning Java when it first came out may have been risky, but it paid off 
handsomely for the early adopters who are now at the top of that field.
Review and rebalance. 
 
 This is a very dynamic industry. That hot technolog
y
you started investigating last month might be stone cold by now. Maybe you nee
d
to brush up on that database technology that you haven't used in a while. O
r
perhaps you could be better positioned for that new job opening if you tried out tha
t
other language…
.
Of all these guidelines, the most important one is the simplest to do:
Tip 8
 Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
Goals
Now that you have some guidelines on what and when to add to your knowledge portfolio, 
what's the best way to go about acquiring intellectual capital with which to fund your 
portfolio? Here are a few suggestions.
Learn at least one new language every year. 
 
 Different languages solve th
e
same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can 
help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut. Additionally, learning 
many languages is far easier now, thanks to the wealth of freely available software 
on the Internet (see page 267).
Read a technical book each quarter. 
 
 Bookstores are full of technical books o
n
interesting topics related to your current project. Once you're in the habit, read a 
book a month. After you've mastered the technologies you're currently using, 
branch out and study some that 
don't
 relate to your project.
Read nontechnical books, too. 
 
 It is important to remember that computers ar
e
used by 
people
—people whose needs you are trying to satisfy. Don't forget th
e
human side of the equation
.
Take classes. 
 
 Look for interesting courses at your local community college o

Take classes. 
 
 Look for interesting courses at your local community college o
r
university, or perhaps at the next trade show that comes to town.
Participate in local user groups. 
 
 Don't just go and listen, but activel
y
participate. Isolation can be deadly to your career; find out what people are working 
on outside of your company.
Experiment with different environments. 
 
 If you've worked only in Windows
,
play with Unix at home (the freely available Linux is perfect for this). If you've used 
only 
makefiles
 and an editor, try an IDE, and vice versa.
Stay current. 
 
 Subscribe to trade magazines and other journals (see page 262 fo
r
 recommendations). Choose some that cover technology different from that of your 
current project.
Get wired. 
 
 Want to know the ins and outs of a new language or othe
r
technology? Newsgroups are a great way to find out what experiences other 
people are having with it, the particular jargon they use, and so on. Surf the Web 
for papers, commercial sites, and any other sources of information you can find.
It's important to continue investing. Once you feel comfortable with some new language or 
bit of technology, move on. Learn another one.
It doesn't matter whether you ever use any of these technologies on a project, or even 
whether you put them on your resume. The process of learning will expand your thinking, 
opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things. The cross-pollination of 
ideas is important; try to apply the lessons you've learned to your current project. Even if 
your project doesn't use that technology, perhaps you can borrow some ideas. Get familiar 
with object orientation, for instance, and you'll write plain C programs differently.
Opportunities for Learning
So you're reading voraciously, you're on top of all the latest breaking developments in your 
field (not an easy thing to do), and somebody asks you a question. You don't have the 
faintest idea what the answer is, and freely admit as much.
Don't let it stop there.
 Take it as a personal challenge to find the answer. Ask a guru. (If 
you don't have a guru in your office, you should be able to find one on the Internet: see the 
box on on the facing page.) Search the Web. Go to the library.
[4]
[4]
 In this era of the Web, many people seem to have forgotten about real live libraries filled with researc
h
material and staff.
If you can't find the answer yourself, find out who 
can.
 Don't let it rest. Talking to othe
r
people will help build your personal network, and you may surprise yourself by findin
g
solutions to other, unrelated problems along the way. And that old portfolio just keep
s
getting bigger…
.
All of this reading and researching takes time, and time is already in short supply. So yo
u
need to plan ahead. Always have something to read in an otherwise dead moment. Tim
e
spent waiting for doctors and dentists can be a great opportunity to catch up on you
r
reading—but be sure to bring your own magazine with you, or you might find yoursel
f
 thumbing through a dog-eared 1973 article about Papua New Guinea
.
Critical Thinking
The last important point is to think 
critically
 about what you read and hear. You need to 
ensure that the knowledge in your portfolio is accurate and unswayed by either vendor or 
media hype. Beware of the zealots who insist that their dogma provides the 
only
answer—it may or may not be applicable to you and your project
.
Never underestimate the power of commercialism. Just because a Web search engine lists 
a hit first doesn't mean that it's the best match; the content provider can pay to get top 
billing. Just because a bookstore features a book prominently doesn't mean it's a good 
book, or even popular; they may have been paid to place it there.
Tip 9
Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
Unfortunately, there are very few simple answers anymore. But with your extensive 
portfolio, and by applying some critical analysis to the
Care and Cultivation of Gurus
With the global adoption of the Internet, gurus suddenly are as close as your 
Enter
 key. So, how do you find one, and how do you get one to talk with you?
We find there are some simple tricks.
Know exactly what you want to ask, and be as specific as you can be.
Frame your question carefully and politely. Remember that you're asking 
a favor; don't seem to be demanding an answer.
Once you've framed your questioned, stop and look again for the answer. 
 Pick out some keywords and search the web. Look for appropriate FAQs 
(lists of frequently asked questions with answers).
Decide if you want to ask publicly or privately. Usenet news-groups are 
wonderful meeting places for experts on just about any topic, but some 
people are wary of these groups' public nature. Alternatively, you can 
always e-mail your guru directly. Either way, use a meaningful subject 
line. (""
Need Help!!!
"" doesn't cut it.)
Sit back and be patient. People are busy, and it may take days to get a 
specific answer.
Finally, please be sure to thank anyone who responds you. And if you see 
people asking questions 
you
 can answer, play your part and participate.

Challenges
Start learning a new language this week. Always programmed in C++? Try 
Smalltalk [
URL 13
] or Squeak [
URL 14
]. Doing Java? Try Eiffel [
URL 10
] or TOM 
[
URL 15
]. See page 267 for sources of other free compilers and environments.
Start reading a new book (but finish this one first') If you are doing very detailed 
implementation and coding, read a book on design and architecture. If you are 
doing high-level design, read a book on coding techniques.
Get out and talk technology with people who aren't Involved in your current project, 
or who don't work for the same company. Network in your company cafeteria, or 
maybe seek out fellow enthusiasts at a local user's group meeting.

Communicate!
I believe that it is better to be looked over than it is to be overlooked.
Mae West, 
Belle of the Nineties,
 1934
Maybe we can learn a lesson from Ms. West. It's not just what you've got, but also how you 
package it. Having the best ideas, the finest code, or the most pragmatic thinking is 
ultimately sterile unless you can communicate with other people. A good idea is an orphan 
without effective communication.
As developers, we have to communicate on many levels. We spend hours in meetings, 
listening and talking. We work with end users, trying to understand their needs. We write 
code, which communicates our intentions","[0.020284154, -0.0013771852, 0.009392857, 0.024684837, 0.03728751, -0.0414516, -0.025489263, 0.034984645, -0.009992233, 0.055710446, 0.069843106,

" work with end users, trying to understand their needs. We write 
code, which communicates our intentions to a machine and documents our thinking for 
future generations of developers. We write proposals and memos requesting and justifying 
resources, reporting our status, and suggesting new approaches. And we work daily within 
our teams to advocate our ideas, modify existing practices, and suggest new ones. A large 
part of our day is spent communicating, so we need to do it well.
We've put together a list of ideas that we find useful.
Know What You Want to Say
Probably the most difficult part of the more formal styles of communication used in 
business is working out exactly what it is you want to say. Fiction writers plot out their 
books in detail before they start, but people writing technical documents are often happy to 
sit down at a keyboard, enter ""1. Introduction,"" and start typing whatever comes into their 
heads next.
Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself, ""Does this get across 
whatever I'm trying to say?"" Refine it until it does.
This approach is not just applicable to writing documents. When you're faced with an 
important meeting or a phone call with a major client, jot down the ideas you want to 
communicate, and plan a couple of strategies for getting them across.
Know Your Audience
 You're communicating only if you're conveying information. To do that, you need to 
understand the needs, interests, and capabilities of your audience. We've all sat in 
meetings where a development geek glazes over the eyes of the vice president of 
marketing with a long monologue on the merits of some arcane technology. This isn't 
communicating: it's just talking, and it's annoying.
[5]
[5]
 The word
 
annoy
 comes from the Old French 
enui,
 which also means ""to bore.""
Form a strong mental picture of your audience. The acrostic wisdom, shown in 
Figure 1.1
on the following page, may help.

e
Say you want to suggest a Web-based system to allow your end users to submit bug 
reports. You can present this system in many different ways, depending on your audience. 
End users will appreciate that they can submit bug reports 24 hours a day without waiting 
on the phone. Your marketing department will be able to use this fact to boost sales. 
Managers in the support department will have two reasons to be happy: fewer staff will be 
needed, and problem reporting will be automated. Finally, developers may enjoy getting 
experience with Web-based client-server technologies and a new database engine. By 
making the appropriate pitch to each group, you'll get them all excited about your project.
Choose Your Moment
It's six o'clock on Friday afternoon, following a week when the auditors have been in. Your 
boss's youngest is in the hospital, it's pouring rain outside, and the commute home is 
guaranteed to be a nightmare. This probably isn't a good time to ask her for a memory 
upgrade for your PC.
As part of understanding what your audience needs to hear, you need to work out wha
t
their priorities are. Catch a manager who's just been given a hard time by her bos
s
because some source code got lost, and you'll have a more receptive listener to your idea
s
 on source code repositories. Make what you're saying relevant in time, as well as i
n
content. Sometimes all it takes is the simple question ""Is this a good time to talk about…?
""
Choose a Style
Adjust the style of your delivery to suit your audience. Some people want a formal ""just the 
facts"" briefing. Others like a long, wide-ranging chat before getting down to business. When 
it comes to written documents, some like to receive large bound reports, while others 
expect a simple memo or e-mail. If in doubt, ask.
Remember, however, that you are half of the communication transaction. If someone says 
they need a paragraph describing something and you can't see any way of doing it in less 
than several pages, tell them so. Remember, that kind of feedback is a form of 
communication, too.
Make It Look Good
Your ideas are important. They deserve a good-looking vehicle to convey them to your 
audience.
Too many developers (and their managers) concentrate solely on content when producing 
written documents. We think this is a mistake. Any chef will tell you that you can slave in 
the kitchen for hours only to ruin your efforts with poor presentation.
There is no excuse today for producing poor-looking printed documents. Modern word 
processors (along with layout systems such as LaTeX and troff) can produce stunning 
output. You need to learn just a few basic commands. If your word processor supports 
style sheets, use them. (Your company may already have defined style sheets that you can 
use.) Learn how to set page headers and footers. Look at the sample documents included 
with your package to get ideas on style and layout. 
Check the spelling,
 first automatically 
and then by hand. After awl, their are spelling miss steaks that the chequer can knot ketch.
Involve Your Audience
We often find that the documents we produce end up being less important than the 
process we go through to produce them. If possible, involve your readers with early drafts 
of your document. Get their feedback, and pick their brains. You'll build a good working 
relationship, and you'll probably produce a better document in the process.
 Be a Listener
There's one technique that you must use if you want people to listen to you: 
listen to them.
Even if this is a situation where you have all the information, even if this is a forma
l
meeting with you standing in front of 20 suits—if you don't listen to them, they won't liste
n
to you
.
Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or have them summarize what you tell them. 
Turn the meeting into a dialog, and you'll make your point more effectively. Who knows, 
you might even learn something.
Get Back to People
If you ask someone a question, you feel they're impolite if they don't respond. But how 
often do you fail to get back to people when they send you an e-mail or a memo asking for 
information or requesting some action? In the rush of everyday life, it's easy to forget. 
Always respond to e-mails and voice mails, even if the response is simply ""I'll get back to 
you later."" Keeping people informed makes them far more forgiving of the occasional slip, 
and makes them feel that you haven't forgotten them.
Tip 10
It's Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
Unless you work in a vacuum, you need to be able to communicate. The more effective 
that communication, the more influential you become.
E-Mail Communication
Everything we've said about communicating in writing applies equally to 
electronic mail. E-mail has evolved to the point where it is main-stay of intra- and 
intercorporate communications. E-mail is used to discuss contracts, to settle

intercorporate communications. E-mail is used to discuss contracts, to settle 
disputes, and as evidence in court. But for some reason, people who would 
 never send out a shabby paper document are happy to fling nasty-looking e-mail 
around the world.
Our e-mail tips are simple:
Proofread before you hit 
.
Check the spelling.
Keep the format simple. Some people read e-mail using proportional 
fonts, so the ASCII art pictures you laboriously created will look to them 
like hen-scratchings.
Use rich-text or HTML formatted mail only if you know that all your 
recipients can read it. Plain text is universal.
Try to keep quoting to a minimum. No one likes to recieve back their own 
100-line e-mail with ""I agree"" tacked on.
If you're quoting other people's e-mail, be sure to attribute it, and quote it 
inline (rather than as an attachment).
Don't flame unless you want it to come back and haunt you later.
Check your list of recipients before sending. A recent 
Wall Street 
Journal
 article described an employee who took to distributing criticisms 
of his boss over departmental e-mail. without realizing that his boss was 
included on the distribution list.
Archive and organize your e-mail–both the import stuff you receive an
d
the mail you send
.
As various microsoft and Netscape employees discovered during the 1999 
Department of Justice investigation, e-mail is forever. Try to give the same 
attention and care to e-mail as you would to any written memo or report.

Chapter 2. A Pragmatic Approac
h
There are certain tips and tricks that apply at all levels of software development, ideas that 
are almost axiomatic, and processes that are virtually universal. However, these 
approaches are rarely documented as such; you'll mostly find them written down as odd 
sentences in discussions of design, project management, or coding.
In this chapter we'll bring these ideas and processes together. The first two sections, 
The 
Evils of Duplication
 and 
Orthogonality,
 are closely related. The first warns you not to 
duplicate knowledge throughout your systems, the second not to split any one piece of 
knowledge across multiple system components.
As the pace of change increases, it becomes harder and harder to keep our applications 
relevant. In 
Reversibility,
 we'll look at some techniques that help insulate your projects 
from their changing environment.
The next two sections are also related. In 
Tracer Bullets,
 we talk about a style of 
development that allows you to gather requirements, test designs, and implement code at 
the same time. If this sounds too good to be true, it is: tracer bullet developments are not 
always applicable. When they're not, 
Prototypes and Post-it Notes
 shows you how to use 
prototyping to test architectures, algorithms, interfaces, and ideas.
As computer science slowly matures, designers are producing increasingly higher-level 
languages. While the compiler that accepts ""make it so"" hasn't yet been invented, in 
Domain Languages
 we present some more modest suggestions that you can implement 
for yourself.
Finally, we all work in a world of limited time and resources. You can survive both of these 
scarcities better (and keep your bosses happier) if you get good at working out how long 
things will take, which we cover in 
Estimating.
By keeping these fundamental principles in mind during development, you can write code 
that's better, faster, and stronger. You can even make it look easy.

The Evils of Duplication
Giving a computer two contradictory pieces of knowledge was Captain James T. Kirk's 
preferred way of disabling a marauding artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the same 
principle can be effective in bringing down 
your
 code.
As programmers, we collect, organize, maintain, and harness knowledge. We document 
knowledge in specifications, we make it come alive in running code, and we use it to 
provide the checks needed during testing.
Unfortunately, knowledge isn't stable. It changes—often rapidly. Your understanding of 
a
requirement may change following a meeting with the client. The government changes 
a
regulation and some business logic gets outdated. Tests may show that the chose
n
algorithm won't work. All this instability means that we spend a large part of our time i
n
maintenance mode, reorganizing and reexpressing the knowledge in our systems
.
Most people assume that maintenance begins when an application is released, that 
maintenance means fixing bugs and enhancing features. We think these people are wrong. 
Programmers are constantly in maintenance mode. Our understanding changes day by 
day. New requirements arrive as we're designing or coding. Perhaps the environment 
changes. Whatever the reason, maintenance is not a discrete activity, but a routine part of 
the entire development process.
When we perform maintenance, we have to find and change the representations o
f
things—those capsules of knowledge embedded in the application. The problem is that it'
s
easy to duplicate knowledge in the specifications, processes, and programs that w
e
develop, and when we do so, we invite a maintenance nightmare—one that starts wel
l
before the application ships
.
We feel that the only way to develop software reliably, and to make our developments 
easier to understand and maintain, is to follow what we call the 
DRY
 principle:
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative 
representation within a system.
Why do we call it 
DRY?

The alternative is to have the same thing expressed in two or more places. If you change 
one, you have to remember to change the others, or, like the alien computers, your 
program will be brought to its knees by a contradiction. It isn't a question of whether you'll 
remember: it's a question of when you'll forget.

": it's a question of when you'll forget.
You'll find the 
DRY
 principle popping up time and time again throughout this book, often in 
contexts that have nothing to do with coding. We feel that it is one of the most important 
tools in the Pragmatic Programmer's tool box.
In this section we'll outline the problems of duplication and suggest general strategies for 
dealing with it.
How Does Duplication Arise?
Most of the duplication we see falls into one of the following categories:
Imposed duplication. 
 
 Developers feel they have no choice—the environmen
t
seems to require duplication
.
Inadvertent duplication. 
 
 Developers don't realize that they are duplicatin
g
information.
Impatient duplication. 
 
 Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seem
s
easier.
Interdeveloper duplication. 
 
 Multiple people on a team (or on different teams
)
duplicate a piece of information.
Let's look at these four 
i
's of duplication in more detail.
Imposed Duplication
Sometimes, duplication seems to be forced on us. Project standards may require 
 documents that contain duplicated information, or documents that duplicate information in 
the code. Multiple target platforms each require their own programming languages, 
libraries, and development environments, which makes us duplicate shared definitions and 
procedures. Programming languages themselves require certain structures that duplicate 
information. We have all worked in situations where we felt powerless to avoid duplication. 
And yet often there are ways of keeping each piece of knowledge in one place, honoring 
the 
DRY
 principle, and making our lives easier at the same time. Here are some 
techniques:
Multiple representations of information. 
 
 At the coding level, we often need to hav
e
the same information represented in different forms. Maybe we're writing a client-server 
application, using different languages on the client and server, and need to represent some 
shared structure on both. Perhaps we need a class whose attributes mirror the schema of 
a database table. Maybe you're writing a book and want to include excerpts of programs 
that you also will compile and test.
With a bit of ingenuity you can normally remove the need for duplication. Often the answer 
is to write a simple filter or code generator. Structures in multiple languages can be built 
from a common metadata representation using a simple code generator each time the 
software is built (an example of this is shown in 
Figure 3.4
). Class definitions can be 
generated automatically from the online database schema, or from the metadata used to 
build the schema in the first place. The code extracts in this book are inserted by a 
preprocessor each time we format the text. The trick is to make the process active: this 
cannot be a one-time conversion, or we're back in a position of duplicating data.
Documentation in code.
 
 Programmers are taught to comment their code: good cod
e
has lots of comments. Unfortunately, they are never taught 
why
 code needs comments: 
bad code 
requires
 lots of comments.
The 
DRY
 principle tells us to keep the low-level knowledge in the code, where it belongs, 
and reserve the comments for other, high-level explanations. Otherwise, we're duplicating 
knowledge, and every change means changing both the code and the comments. The 
comments will inevitably become out of date, and untrustworthy comments are worse than 
no comments at all. (See 
It's All Writing
, for more information on comments.)
Documentation and code. 
 
 You write documentation, then you write code. Somethin
g
changes, and you amend the documentation and update the code. The documentation and 
code both contain representations of the same knowledge. And we all know that in the heat 
of the moment, with deadlines looming and important clients clamoring, we tend to defer 
 the updating of documentation.
Dave once worked on an international telex switch. Quite understandably, the client 
demanded an exhaustive test specification and required that the software pass all tests on 
each delivery. To ensure that the tests accurately reflected the specification, the team 
generated them programmatically from the document itself. When the client amended their 
specification, the test suite changed automatically. Once the team convinced the client that 
the procedure was sound, generating acceptance tests typically took only a few seconds.
Language issues. 
 
 Many languages impose considerable duplication in the source
.
Often this comes about when the language separates a module's interface from its 
implementation. C and C++ have header files that duplicate the names and type 
information of exported variables, functions, and (for C++) classes. Object Pascal even 
duplicates this information in the same file. If you are using remote procedure calls or 
CORBA [
URL 29
], you'll duplicate interface information between the interface specification 
and the code that implements it.
There is no easy technique for overcoming the requirements of a language. While some 
development environments hide the need for header files by generating them 
automatically, and Object Pascal allows you to abbreviate repeated function declarations, 
you are generally stuck with what you're given. At least with most language-based issues, 
a header file that disagrees with the implementation will generate some form of compilation 
or linkage error. You can still get things wrong, but at least you'll be told about it fairly early 
on.
Think also about comments in header and implementation files. There is absolutely no 
point in duplicating a function or class header comment between the two files. Use the 
header files to document interface issues, and the implementation files to document the 
nitty-gritty details that users of your code don't need to know.
Inadvertent Duplication
Sometimes, duplication comes about as the result of mistakes in the design.
Let's look at an example from the distribution industry. Say our analysis reveals that, 
among other attributes, a truck has a type, a license number, and a driver. Similarly, a 
delivery route is a combination of a route, a truck, and a driver. We code up some classes 
based on this understanding.
 But what happens when Sally calls in sick and we have to change drivers? Both 
Truck
 and 
DeliveryRoute
 contain a driver. Which one do we change? Clearly this duplication is bad
.
Normalize it according to the underlying business model—does a truck really have a drive
r
as part of its underlying attribute set? Does a route? Or maybe there needs to be a thir
d
object that knits together a driver, a truck, and a route. Whatever the eventual solution
,
avoid this kind of unnormalized data
.
There is a slightly less obvious kind of unnormalized data that occurs when we have 
multiple data elements that are mutually dependent. Let's look at a class representing a 
line:
                                       
 
    
class
 Line {
     
public:
      Point  start;
      Point  end;
      
double
 length;
    };
At first sight, this class might appear reasonable. A line clearly has a start and end, and will 
always have a length (even if it's zero). But we have duplication. The length is defined by 
the start and end points: change one of the points and the length changes. It's better to 
make the length a calculated field:
                                       
 
    
class
 Line {
     
public:
      Point  start","[0.007251766, 0.028003938, 0.04123963, -0.012155939, 0.043747447, 0.04508495, 0.018042339, -0.008672861, 0.015297674, 0.043496665, 0.07985999, -0.051047977, 0.0066004307,

Later on in the development process, you may choose to violate the

performance reasons. Frequently this occurs when you need to cache data to avoid 
repeating expensive operations. The trick is to localize the impact. The violation is not 
exposed to the outside world: only the methods within the class have to worry about 
keeping things straight.

This example also illustrates an important issue for object-oriented languages such as Java 
and C++. Where possible, always use accessor functions to read and write the attributes of 
objects.
[1]
 It will make it easier to add functionality, such as caching, in the future
.
[1]
 The use of accessor functions ties in with Meyer's
 
Uniform Access principle
 |Mey97b], which states 
that ""All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not 
betray whether they are Implemented through storage or through computation.""
Impatient Duplication
Every project has time pressures—forces that can drive the best of us to take shortcuts
.
Need a routine similar to one you've written? You'll be tempted to copy the original an
d
make a few changes. Need a value to represent the maximum number of points? If 
I
change the header file, the whole project will get rebuilt. Maybe I should just use a litera
l
number here; and here; and here. Need a class like one in the Java runtime? The source i
s
available, so why not just copy it and make the changes you need (license provision
s
notwithstanding)
?
 If you feel this temptation, remember the hackneyed aphorism ""shortcuts make for long 
delays."" You may well save some seconds now, but at the potential loss of hours later. 
Think about the issues surrounding the Y2K fiasco. Many were caused by the laziness of 
developers not parameterizing the size of date fields or implementing centralized libraries 
of date services.
Impatient duplication is an easy form to detect and handle, but it takes discipline and a 
willingness to spend time up front to save pain later.
Interdeveloper Duplication
On the other hand, perhaps the hardest type of duplication to detect and handle occurs 
between different developers on a project. Entire sets of functionality may be inadvertently 
duplicated, and that duplication could go undetected for years, leading to maintenance 
problems. We heard firsthand of a U.S. state whose governmental computer systems were 
surveyed for Y2K compliance. The audit turned up more than 10,000 programs, each 
containing its own version of Social Security number validation.
At a high level, deal with the problem by having a clear design, a strong technical project 
leader (see 
Pragmatic Teams
), and a well-understood division of responsibilities within the 
design. However, at the module level, the problem is more insidious. Commonly needed 
functionality or data that doesn't fall into an obvious area of responsibility can get 
implemented many times over.
We feel that the best way to deal with this is to encourage active and frequen
t
communication between developers. Set up forums to discuss common problems. (O
n
past projects, we have set up private Usenet newsgroups to allow developers to exchang
e
ideas and ask questions. This provides a nonintrusive way of communicating—even acros
s
multiple sites—while retaining a permanent history of everything said.) Appoint a tea
m
member as the project librarian, whose job is to facilitate the exchange of knowledge. Hav
e
a central place in the source tree where utility routines and scripts can be deposited. An
d
make a point of reading other people's source code and documentation, either informally o
r
during code reviews. You're not snooping—you're learning from them. And remember, th
e
access is reciprocal—don't get twisted about other people poring (pawing?) through
 
your
code, either.
Tip 12
Make It Easy to Reuse
 What you're trying to do is foster an environment where it's easier to find and reuse 
existing stuff than to write it yourself. 
If it isn't easy, people won't do it.
 And if you fail to 
reuse, you risk duplicating knowledge.

Orthogonality
Orthogonality is a critical concept if you want to produce systems that are easy to design, 
build, test, and extend. However, the concept of orthogonality is rarely taught directly. 
Often it is an implicit feature of various other methods and techniques you learn. This is a 
mistake. Once you learn to apply the principle of orthogonality directly, you'll notice an 
immediate improvement in the quality of systems you produce.
What Is Orthogonality?
""Orthogonality"" is a term borrowed from geometry. Two lines are orthogonal if they meet at 
right angles, such as the axes on a graph. In vector terms, the two lines are 
independent.
Move along one of the lines, and your position projected onto the other doesn't change.
In computing, the term has come to signify a kind of independence or decoupling. Two or 
more things are orthogonal if changes in one do not affect any of the others. In a 
well-designed system, the database code will be orthogonal to the user interface: you can 
change the interface without affecting the database, and swap databases without changing 
the interface.
Before we look at the benefits of orthogonal systems, let's first look at a system that isn't 
orthogonal.
A Nonorthogonal System
You're on a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon when the pilot, who made the obvious 
 mistake of eating fish for lunch, suddenly groans and faints. Fortunately, he left you

you try it, you discover that life isn't that simple. The helicopter's nose drops, and you start

", you discover that life isn't that simple. The helicopter's nose drops, and you start 
to spiral down to the left. Suddenly you discover that you're flying a system where every 
control input has secondary effects. Lower the left-hand lever and you need to add 
compensating backward movement to the right-hand stick and push the right pedal. But 
then each of these changes affects all of the other controls again. Suddenly you're juggling 
an unbelievably complex system, where every change impacts all the other inputs. Your 
workload is phenomenal: your hands and feet are constantly moving, trying to balance all 
the interacting forces.
[2]
 Helicopters have four basic controls. The
 
cyclic
 is the stick you hold in your right hand. Move it, and 
the helicopter moves in the corresponding direction. Your left hand holds the 
collective pitch lever.
 Pull 
up on this and you increase the pitch on all the blades, generating lift. At the end of the pitch lever is the 
throttle.
 Finally you have two foot 
pedals,
 which vary the amount of tail rotor thrust and so help turn the 
helicopter.
Helicopter controls are decidedly not orthogonal.
Benefits of Orthogonality
As the helicopter example illustrates, nonorthogonal systems are inherently more complex 
to change and control. When components of any system are highly interdependent, there is 
no such thing as a local fix.
Tip 13
Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things
We want to design components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, 
well-defined purpose (what Yourdon and Constantine call 
cohesion
 [
YC86
]). When 
components are isolated from one another, you know that you can change one without 
having to worry about the rest. As long as you don't change that component's external 
interfaces, you can be comfortable that you won't cause problems that ripple through the 
entire system.
 You get two major benefits if you write orthogonal systems: increased productivity and 
reduced risk.
Gain Productivity
Changes are localized, so development time and testing time are reduced. It i
s
easier to write relatively small, self-contained components than a single large bloc
k
of code. Simple components can be designed, coded, unit tested, and the
n
forgotten—there is no need to keep changing existing code as you add new code
.
An orthogonal approach also promotes reuse. If components have specific, 
well-defined responsibilities, they can be combined with new components in ways 
that were not envisioned by their original implementors. The more loosely coupled 
your systems, the easier they are to reconfigure and reengineer.
There is a fairly subtle gain in productivity when you combine orthogonal 
components. Assume that one component does 
M
 distinct things and another does 
N
 things. If they are orthogonal and you combine them, the result does 
M × 
N
things. However, if the two components are not orthogonal, there will be overlap, 
and the result will do less. You get more functionality per unit effort by combining 
orthogonal components.
Reduce Risk
An orthogonal approach reduces the risks inherent in any development.
Diseased sections of code are isolated. If a module is sick, it is less likely to spread 
the symptoms around the rest of the system. It is also easier to slice it out and 
transplant in something new and healthy.
The resulting system is less fragile. Make small changes and fixes to a particular 
area, and any problems you generate will be restricted to that area.
An orthogonal system will probably be better tested, because it will be easier to 
design and run tests on its components.
You will not be as tightly tied to a particular vendor, product, or platform, because 
the interfaces to these third-party components will be isolated to smaller parts of the 
overall development.
 Let's look at some of the ways you can apply the principle of orthogonality to your work.
Project Teams
Have you noticed how some project teams are efficient, with everyone knowing what to do 
and contributing fully, while the members of other teams are constantly bickering and don't 
seem able to get out of each other's way?
Often this is an orthogonality issue. When teams are organized with lots of overlap, 
members are confused about responsibilities. Every change needs a meeting of the entire 
team, because any one of them 
might
 be affected.
How do you organize teams into groups with well-defined responsibilities and minimal 
overlap? There's no simple answer. It depends partly on the project and your analysis of 
the areas of potential change. It also depends on the people you have available. Our 
preference is to start by separating infrastructure from application. Each major 
infrastructure component (database, communications interface, middleware layer, and so 
on) gets its own subteam. Each obvious division of application functionality is similarly 
divided. Then we look at the people we have (or plan to have) and adjust the groupings 
accordingly.
You can get an informal measure of the orthogonality of a project team's structure. Simply 
see how many people 
need
 to be involved in discussing each change that is requested. 
The larger the number, the less orthogonal the group. Clearly, an orthogonal team is more 
efficient. (Having said this, we also encourage subteams to communicate constantly with 
each other.)
Design
Most developers are familiar with the need to design orthogonal systems, although they 
may use words such as 
modular, component-based,
 and 
layered
 to describe the 
process. Systems should be composed of a set of cooperating modules, each of which 
implements functionality independent of the others. Sometimes these components are 
organized into layers, each providing a level of abstraction. This layered approach is a 
powerful way to design orthogonal systems. Because each layer uses only the abstractions 
provided by the layers below it, you have great flexibility in changing underlying 
implementations without affecting code. Layering also reduces the risk of runaway 
dependencies between modules. You'll often see layering expressed in diagrams such as 
 Figure 2.1
 on the next page.
Figure 2.1. Typical layer diagram
There is an easy test for orthogonal design. Once you have your components mapped out, 
ask yourself: 
If I dramatically change the requirements behind a particular function, 
how many modules are affected?
 In an orthogonal system, the answer should be ""one.""
[3]
Moving a button on a GUI panel should not require a change in the database schema. 
Adding context-sensitive help should not change the billing subsystem.
[3]
 In reality, this is naive. Unless you are remarkably lucky, most real-world requirements changes wil
l
affect multiple functions in the system. However, if you analyze the change in terms of functions, each 
functional change should still ideally affect just one module.
Let's consider a complex system for monitoring and controlling a heating plant. The original 
requirement called for a graphical user interface, but the requirements were changed to 
add a voice response system with touchtone telephone control of the plant. In an 
orthogonally designed system, you would need to change only those modules associated 
with the user interface to handle this: the underlying logic of controlling the plant would 
remain unchanged","[-0.028075837, -0.0023455406, 0.05273227, 0.020940308, 0.02143485, -0.0047652624, -0.021816352, -0.028075837, -0.015175364, 0.031113736, 0.05216708, -0.022621749, 0.014271059,

with the user interface to handle this: the underlying logic of controlling the plant would 
remain unchanged. In fact, if you structure your system carefully, you should be able to 
support both interfaces with the same underlying code base. 
It's Just a View
, talks about 
writing decoupled code using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, which works 
well in this situation.
Also ask yourself how decoupled your design is from changes in the real world. Are you 
using a telephone number as a customer identifier? What happens when the phone 
company reassigns area codes? 
Don't rely on the properties of things you can't control.
 Toolkits and Libraries
Be careful to preserve the orthogonality of your system as you introduce third-party toolkits 
and libraries. Choose your technologies wisely.
We once worked on a project that required that a certain body of Java code run both locall
y
on a server machine and remotely on a client machine. The alternatives for distributin
g
classes this way were RMI and CORBA. If a class were made remotely accessible usin
g
RMI, every call to a remote method in that class could potentially throw an exception
,
which means that a naive implementation would require us to handle the exceptio
n
whenever our remote classes were used. Using RMI here is clearly not orthogonal: cod
e
calling our remote classes should not have to be aware of their locations. Th
e
alternative—using CORBA—did not impose that restriction: we could write code that wa
s
unaware of our classes' locations
.
When you bring in a toolkit (or even a library from other members of your team), ask 
yourself whether it imposes changes on your code that shouldn't be there. If an object 
persistence scheme is transparent, then it's orthogonal. If it requires you to create or 
access objects in a special way, then it's not. Keeping such details isolated from your code 
has the added benefit of making it easier to change vendors in the future.
The Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) system is an interesting example of orthogonality. In 
most transaction-oriented systems, the application code has to delineate the start and end 
of each transaction. With EJB, this information is expressed declaratively as metadata, 
outside any code. The same application code can run in different EJB transaction 
environments with no change. This is likely to be a model for many future environments.
Another interesting twist on orthogonality is Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), a 
research project at Xerox Parc ([
KLM
+
97
] and [
URL 49
]). AOP lets you express in one 
place behavior that would otherwise be distributed throughout your source code. For 
example, log messages are normally generated by sprinkling explicit calls to some log 
function throughout your source. With AOP, you implement logging orthogonally to the 
things being logged. Using the Java version of AOP, you could write a log message when 
entering any method of class 
Fred
 by coding the 
aspect:
                                       
 
    
aspect
 Trace {
      
advise
 * Fred.*(..) {
        
static before
 {
           Log.write(""-> 
Entering
 "" + thisJoinPoint.methodName);
        }
      }
    }
If you 
weave
 this aspect into your code, trace messages will be generated. If you don't, 
you'll see no messages. Either way, your original source is unchanged.
Coding
Every time you write code you run the risk of reducing the orthogonality of your application. 
Unless you constantly monitor not just what you are doing but also the larger context of the 
application, you might unintentionally duplicate functionality in some other module, or 
express existing knowledge twice.
There are several techniques you can use to maintain orthogonality:
Keep your code decoupled. 
 
 Write shy code—modules that don't revea
l
anything unnecessary to other modules and that don't rely on other modules
'
implementations. Try the Law of Demeter 
[
LH89
], which we discuss in 
Decoupling 
and the Law of Demeter
. If you need to change an object's state, get the object to 
do it for you. This way your code remains isolated from the other code's 
implementation and increases the chances that you'll remain orthogonal.
Avoid global data. 
 
 Every time your code references global data, it ties itself int
o
the other components that share that data. Even globals that you intend only to 
read can lead to trouble (for example, if you suddenly need to change your code to 
be multithreaded). In general, your code is easier to understand and maintain if you 
explicitly pass any required context into your modules. In object-oriented 
applications, context is often passed as parameters to objects' constructors. In 
other code, you can create structures containing the context and pass around 
references to them.
The Singleton pattern in 
Design Patterns
 [
GHJV95
] is a way of ensuring that ther
e
is only one instance of an object of a particular class. Many people use thes
e
singleton objects as a kind of global variable (particularly in languages, such a
s
Java, that otherwise do not support the concept of globals). Be careful wit
h
singletons—they can also lead to unnecessary linkage
.
 Avoid similar functions. 
 
 Often you'll come across a set of functions that all loo
k
similar—maybe they share common code at the start and end, but each has 
a
different central algorithm. Duplicate code is a symptom of structural problems
.
Have a look at the Strategy pattern in
 
Design Patterns
 for a better implementation.
Get into the habit of being constantly critical of your code. Look for any opportunities to 
reorganize it to improve its structure and orthogonality. This process is called 
refactoring,
and it's so important that we've dedicated a section to it (see 
Refactoring
).
Testing
An orthogonally designed and implemented system is easier to test. Because the 
interactions between the system's components are formalized and limited, more of the 
system testing can be performed at the individual module level. This is good news, 
because module level (or unit) testing is considerably easier to specify and perform than 
integration testing. In fact, we suggest that every module have its own unit test built into its 
code, and that these tests be performed automatically as part of the regular build process 
(see 
Code That's Easy to Test
).
Building unit tests is itself an interesting test of orthogonality. What does it take to build and 
link a unit test? Do you have to drag in a large percentage of the rest of the system just to 
get a test to compile or link? If so, you've found a module that is not well decoupled from 
the rest of the system.
Bug fixing is also a good time to assess the orthogonality of the system as a whole. When 
you come across a problem, assess how localized the fix is. Do you change just one 
module, or are the changes scattered throughout the entire system","[-0.020839956, 0.0058233584, 0.07483107, 0.022314962, 0.04606112, 0.02733875, -0.019452572, -0.027908308, 0.0086309835, 0.03613038,

" fix is. Do you change just one 
module, or are the changes scattered throughout the entire system? When you make a 
change, does it fix everything, or do other problems mysteriously arise? This is a good 
opportunity to bring automation to bear. If you use a source code control system (and you 
will after reading 
Source Code Control
), tag bug fixes when you check the code back in 
after testing. You can then run monthly reports analyzing trends in the number of source 
files affected by each bug fix.
Documentation
Perhaps surprisingly, orthogonality also applies to documentation. The axes are content 
and presentation. With truly orthogonal documentation, you should be able to change the 
appearance dramatically without changing the content. Modern word processors provide 
 style sheets and macros that help (see 
It's All Writing
).
Living with Orthogonality
Orthogonality is closely related to the 
DRY
 principle introduced on page 27. With 
DRY,
you're looking to minimize duplication within a system, whereas with orthogonality you 
reduce the interdependency among the system's components. It may be a clumsy word, 
but if you use the principle of orthogonality, combined closely with the 
DRY
 principle, you'll 
find that the systems you develop are more flexible, more understandable, and easier to 
debug, test, and maintain.
If you're brought into a project where people are desperately struggling to make changes, 
and where every change seems to cause four other things to go wrong, remember the 
nightmare with the helicopter. The project probably is not orthogonally designed and 
coded. It's time to refactor.
And, if you're a helicopter pilot, don't eat the fish…

 Challenges
Consider the difference between large GUI-oriented tools typically found on 
Windows systems and small but combinable command line utilities used at shell 
prompts. Which set is more orthogonal, and why? Which is easier to use for exactly 
the purpose for which it was intended? Which set is easier to combine with other 
tools to meet new challenges?
C++ supports multiple inheritance, and Java allows a class to implement multiple 
interfaces. What impact does using these facilities have on orthogonality? Is there a 
difference in impact between using multiple inheritance and multiple interfaces? Is 
there a difference between using delegation and using inheritance?

Reversibility
Nothing is more dangerous than an idea if it's the only one you have.
Emil-Auguste Chartier, 
Propos sur
 
la religion,
 1938
Engineers prefer simple, single solutions to problems. Math tests that allow you to proclaim 
with great confidence that 
x =
 2 are much more comfortable than fuzzy, warm essays 
about the myriad causes of the French Revolution. Management tends to agree with the 
engineers: single, easy answers fit nicely on spreadsheets and project plans.
If only the real world would cooperate! Unfortunately, while 
x
 is 2 today, it may need to be 
5
tomorrow, and 3 next week. Nothing is forever—and if you rely heavily on some fact, yo
u
can almost guarantee that it
 
will
 change.
There is always more than one way to implement something, and there is usually more 
than one vendor available to provide a third-party product. If you go into a project 
hampered by the myopic notion that there is only 
one
 way to do it, you may be in for an 
unpleasant surprise. Many project teams have their eyes forcibly opened as the future 
unfolds:
""But you said we'd use database XYZ! We are 85% done coding th
e
project, we can't change now!"" the programmer protested. ""Sorry, bu
t
our company decided to standardize on database PDQ instead—for al
l
projects. It's out of my hands. We'll just have to recode. All of you will b
e
working weekends until further notice.
""
Changes don't have to be that Draconian, or even that immediate. But as time goes by
,
and your project progresses, you may find yourself stuck in an untenable position. Wit
h
every critical decision, the project team commits to a smaller target—a narrower version o
f
reality that has fewer options
.
By the time many critical decisions have been made, the target becomes so small that if it 
moves, or the wind changes direction, or a butterfly in Tokyo flaps its wings, you miss.
[4]
And you may miss by a huge amount.
[4]
 Take a nonlinear, or chaotic, system and apply a small change to one of its inputs. You may get 
a
large and often unpredictable result. The clichéd butterfly flapping its wings in Tokyo could be the start o
f
 a chain of events that ends up generating a tornado in Texas. Does this sound like any projects you 
know?
The problem is that critical decisions aren't easily reversible.
Once you decide to use this vendor's database, or that architectural pattern, or a certain 
deployment model (client-server versus standalone, for instance), you are committed to a 
course of action that cannot be undone, except at great expense.
Reversibility
Many of the topics in this book are geared to producing flexible, adaptable software. B
y
sticking to their recommendations—especially the
 
DRY
 principle (page 26), decouplin
g
(page 138), and use of metadata (page 144)—we don't have to make as many critical
,
irreversible decisions. This is a good thing, because we don't always make the bes
t
decisions the first time around. We commit to a certain technology only to discover we can'
t
hire enough people with the necessary skills. We lock in a certain third-party vendor jus
t
before they get bought out by their competitor. Requirements, users, and hardware chang
e
faster than we can get the software developed
.

Suppose you decide, early in the project, to use a relational database from vendor A. Much 
later, during performance testing, you discover that the database is simply too slow, but 
that the object database from vendor B is faster. With most conventional projects, you'd be 
out of luck. Most of the time, calls to third-party products are entangled throughout the 
code. But if you 
really
 abstracted the idea of a database out—to the point where it simpl
y
provides persistence as a service—then you have the flexibility to change horses i
n
midstream
.
Similarly, suppose the project begins as a client-server model, but then, late in the game, 
marketing decides that servers are too expensive for some clients, and they want a 
stand-alone version. How hard would that be for you? Since it's just a deployment issue, it 
shouldn't take more than a few days.
 If it would take longer, then you haven't thought 
about reversibility. The other direction is even more interesting. What if the stand-alone 
product you are making needs to be deployed in a client-server or 
n
-tier fashion? 
That 
shouldn't be hard either.
The mistake lies in assuming that any decision is cast in stone—and in not preparing fo
r
the contingencies that might arise. Instead of carving decisions in stone, think of the
m
more as being written in the sand at the beach. A big wave can come along and wipe the
m
out at any time
.
 Tip 14
There Are No Final Decisions
Flexible Architecture
While many people try to keep their 
code
 flexible, you also need to think about maintaining 
flexibility in the areas of architecture, deployment, and vendor integration.
Technologies such as CORBA can help insulate portions of a project from changes in 
development language or platform. Is the performance of Java on that platform not up to 
expectations? Recode the client in C++, and nothing else needs to change. Is the rules 
engine in C++ not flexible enough? Switch over to a Smalltalk version. With a CORBA 
architecture, you have to take a hit only for the component you are replacing; the other 
components shouldn't be affected.
Are you developing for Unix? Which one? Do you have all of the portability concern
s
addressed? Are you developing for a particular version of Windows? Which one—3.1, 95
,
98, NT, CE, or 2000? How hard will it be to support other versions? If you keep decision
s
soft and pliable, it won't be hard at all. If you have poor encapsulation, high coupling, an
d
hard-coded logic or parameters in the code, it might be impossible
.
Not sure how marketing wants to deploy the system? Think about it up front and you can 
support a stand-alone, client-server, or 
n
-tier model just by changing a configuration file. 
We've written programs that do just that.
Normally, you can simply hide a third-party product behind a well-defined, abstract 
interface. In fact, we've always been able to do so on any project we've worked on. But 
suppose you couldn't isolate it that cleanly. What if you had to sprinkle certain statements 
liberally throughout the code? Put that requirement in metadata, and use some automatic 
mechanism, such as Aspects (see page 39) or Perl, to insert the necessary statements into 
the code itself. Whatever mechanism you use, 
make it reversible.
 If something is added 
automatically, it can be taken out automatically as well.
No one knows what the future may hold, especially not us! So enable your code to 
 rock-n-roll: to ""rock on"" when it can, to roll with the punches when it must.

Time for a little quantum mechanics with Schrödinger's cat. Suppose you have 
a
cat in a closed box, along with a radioactive particle. The particle has exactly a 50% 
chance of fissioning into two. If it does, the cat will be killed. If it doesn't, the cat will 
be okay. So, is the cat dead or alive? According to Schrödinger, the correct answe
r
is 
both.
 Every time a sub-nuclear reaction takes place that has two possible 
outcomes, the universe is cloned. In one, the event occurred, in the other it didn't. 
The cat's alive in one universe, dead in another. Only when you open the box do 
you know which universe 
you
 are in.
No wonder coding for the future is difficult.
But think of code evolution along the same lines as a box full of Schrödinger's cats
:
every decision results in a different version of the future. How many possible 
futures can your code support? Which ones are more likely? How hard will it be to 
support them when the time comes?
Dare you open the box?

Tracer Bullets
Ready, fire, aim
…
There are two ways to fire a machine gun in the dark.
[5]
 You can find out exactly wher
e
your target is (range, elevation, and azimuth). You can determine the environmental 
conditions (temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind, and so on). You can determine the 
precise specifications of the cartridges and bullets you are using, and their interactions with 
the actual gun you are firing. You can then use tables or a firing computer to calculate the 
exact bearing and elevation of the barrel. If everything works exactly as specified, your 
tables are correct, and the environment doesn't change, your bullets should land close to 
their target.
[5]
 To be pedantic, there are many ways of firing a machine gun in the dark, including closing your eye
s
and spraying out bullets. But this is an analogy, and we're allowed to take liberties.
Or you could use tracer bullets.
Tracer bullets are loaded at intervals on the ammo belt alongside regular ammunition. 
When they're fired, their phosphorus ignites and leaves a pyrotechnic trail from the gun to 
whatever they hit. If the tracers are hitting the target, then so are the regular bullets.
Not surprisingly, tracer bullets are preferred to the labor of calculation. The feedback is 
immediate, and because they operate in the same environment as the real ammunition, 
external effects are minimized.
The analogy might be violent, but it applies to new projects, particularly when you're 
building something that hasn't been built before. Like the gunners, you're trying to hit a 
target in the dark. Because your users have never seen a system like this before, their 
requirements may be vague. Because you may be using algorithms, techniques, 
languages, or libraries you aren't familiar with, you face a large number of unknowns. And 
because projects take time to complete, you can pretty much guarantee the environment

"s. And 
because projects take time to complete, you can pretty much guarantee the environment 
you're working in will change before you're done.
The classic response is to specify the system to death. Produce reams of paper itemizing 
every requirement, tying down every unknown, and constraining the environment. Fire the 
gun using dead reckoning. One big calculation up front, then shoot and hope.
 Pragmatic Programmers, however, tend to prefer using tracer bullets.
Code That Glows in the Dark
Tracer bullets work because they operate in the same environment and under the same 
constraints as the real bullets. They get to the target fast, so the gunner gets immediate 
feedback. And from a practical standpoint they're a relatively cheap solution.
To get the same effect in code, we're looking for something that gets us from a requirement 
to some aspect of the final system quickly, visibly, and repeatably.
Tip 15
Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target
We once undertook a complex client-server database marketing project. Part of its 
requirement was the ability to specify and execute temporal queries. The servers were a 
range of relational and specialized databases. The client GUI, written in Object Pascal, 
used a set of C libraries to provide an interface to the servers. The user's query was stored 
on the server in a Lisp-like notation before being converted to optimized SQL just prior to 
execution. There were many unknowns and many different environments, and no one was 
too sure how the GUI should behave.
This was a great opportunity to use tracer code. We developed the framework for the front 
end, libraries for representing the queries, and a structure for converting a stored query into 
a database-specific query. Then we put it all together and checked that it worked. For that 
initial build, all we could do was submit a query that listed all the rows in a table, but it 
proved that the UI could talk to the libraries, the libraries could serialize and unserialize a 
query, and the server could generate SQL from the result. Over the following months we 
gradually fleshed out this basic structure, adding new functionality by augmenting each 
component of the tracer code in parallel. When the UI added a new query type, the library 
grew and the SQL generation was made more sophisticated.
Tracer code is not disposable: you write it for keeps. It contains all the error checking, 
structuring, documentation, and self-checking that any piece of production code has. It 
simply is not fully functional. However, once you have achieved an end-to-end connection 
 among the components of your system, you can check how close to the target you are, 
adjusting if necessary. Once you're on target, adding functionality is easy.
Tracer development is consistent with the idea that a project is never finished: there will 
always be changes required and functions to add. It is an incremental approach.
The conventional alternative is a kind of heavy engineering approach: code is divided into 
modules, which are coded in a vacuum. Modules are combined into subassemblies, which 
are then further combined, until one day you have a complete application. Only then can 
the application as a whole be presented to the user and tested.
The tracer code approach has many advantages:
Users get to see something working early. 
 
 If you have successfull
y
communicated what you are doing (see 
Great Expectations
), your users will know 
they are seeing something immature. They won't be disappointed by a lack of 
functionality; they'll be ecstatic to see some visible progress toward their system. 
They also get to contribute as the project progresses, increasing their buy-in. These 
same users will likely be the people who'll tell you how close to the target each 
iteration is.
Developers build a structure to work in. 
 
 The most daunting piece of paper i
s
the one with nothing written on it. If you have worked out all the end-to-end 
interactions of your application, and have embodied them in code, then your team 
won't need to pull as much out of thin air. This makes everyone more productive, 
and encourages consistency.
You have an integration platform. 
 
 As the system is connected end-to-end, yo
u
have an environment to which you can add new pieces of code once they have 
been unit-tested. Rather than attempting a big-bang integration, you'll be 
integrating every day (often many times a day). The impact of each new change is 
more apparent, and the interactions are more limited, so debugging and testing are 
faster and more accurate.
You have something to demonstrate. 
 
 Project sponsors and top brass have 
a
tendency to want to see demos at the most inconvenient times. With tracer code, 
you'll always have something to show them.
You have a better feel for progress. 
 
 In a tracer code development
,
developers tackle use cases one by one. When one is done, they move to the next. 
 It is far easier to measure performance and to demonstrate progress to your user. 
Because each individual development is smaller, you avoid creating those 
monolithic blocks of code that are reported as 95% complete week after week.
Tracer Bullets Don't Always Hit Their Target
Tracer bullets show what you're hitting. This may not always be the target. You then adjust 
your aim until they're on target. That's the point.
It's the same with tracer code. You use the technique in situations where you're not 100
%
certain of where you're going. You shouldn't be surprised if your first couple of attempt
s
miss: the user says ""that's not what I meant,"" or data you need isn't available when yo
u
need it, or performance problems seem likely. Work out how to change what you've got t
o
bring it nearer the target, and be thankful that you've used a lean developmen
t
methodology. A small body of code has low inertia—it is easy and quick to change. You'l
l
be able to gather feedback on your application and generate a new, more accurate versio
n
faster and at less cost than with any other method. And because every major applicatio
n
component is represented in your tracer code, your users can be confident that wha
t
they're seeing is based on reality, not just a paper specification
.
Tracer Code versus Prototyping
You might think that this tracer code concept is nothing more than prototyping under an 
aggressive name. There is a difference. With a prototype, you're aiming to explore specific 
aspects of the final system. With a true prototype, you will throw away whatever you lashed 
together when trying out the concept, and recode it properly using the lessons you've 
learned.
For example, say you're producing an application that helps shippers determine how to 
pack odd-sized boxes into containers. Among other problems, the user interface needs to 
be intuitive and the algorithms you use to determine optimal packing are very complex.
You could prototype a user interface for your end users in a GUI tool. You code only 
enough to make the interface responsive to user actions. Once they've agreed to the 
layout, you might throw","[0.0013243317, 0.054374218, 0.014709933, -0.002272889, 0.04847857, -0.015249881, 0.0145056285, 0.014016757, 0.019438125, 0.0430499, 0.059627764, 0.016723793, -0.01940894,

" make the interface responsive to user actions. Once they've agreed to the 
layout, you might throw it away and recode it, this time with the business logic behind it, 
using the target language. Similarly, you might want to prototype a number of algorithms 
that perform the actual packing. You might code functional tests in a high-level, forgiving 
language such as Perl, and code low-level performance tests in something closer to the 
machine. In any case, once you'd made your decision, you'd start again and code the 
 algorithms in their final environment, interfacing to the real world. This is 
prototyping,
 and it 
is very useful.
The tracer code approach addresses a different problem. You need to know how the 
application as a whole hangs together. You want to show your users how the interactions 
will work in practice, and you want to give your developers an architectural skeleton on 
which to hang code. In this case, you might construct a tracer consisting of a trivial 
implementation of the container packing algorithm (maybe something like first-come, 
first-served) and a simple but working user interface. Once you have all the components in 
the application plumbed together, you have a framework to show your users and your 
developers. Over time, you add to this framework with new functionality, completing 
stubbed routines. But the framework stays intact, and you know the system will continue to 
behave the way it did when your first tracer code was completed.
The distinction is important enough to warrant repeating. Prototyping generates disposable 
code. Tracer code is lean but complete, and forms part of the skeleton of the final system. 
Think of prototyping as the reconnaissance and intelligence gathering that takes place 
before a single tracer bullet is fired.

Prototypes and Post-it Notes
Many different industries use prototypes to try out specific ideas; prototyping is muc
h
cheaper than full-scale production. Car makers, for example, may build many differen
t
prototypes of a new car design. Each one is designed to test a specific aspect of th
e
car—the aerodynamics, styling, structural characteristics, and so on. Perhaps a clay mode
l
will be built for wind tunnel testing, maybe a balsa wood and duct tape model will do for th
e
art department, and so on. Some car companies take this a step further, and now do 
a
great deal of modeling work on the computer, reducing costs even further. In this way, risk
y
or uncertain elements can be tried out without committing to building the real item
.
We build software prototypes in the same fashion, and for the same reasons—to analyz
e
and expose risk, and to offer chances for correction at a greatly reduced cost. Like the ca
r
makers, we can target a prototype to test one or more specific aspects of a project
.
We tend to think of prototypes as code-based, but they don't always have to be. Like the 
car makers, we can build prototypes out of different materials. Post-it notes are great for 
prototyping dynamic things such as workflow and application logic. A user interface can be 
prototyped as a drawing on a whiteboard, as a nonfunctional mock-up drawn with a paint 
program, or with an interface builder.
Prototypes are designed to answer just a few questions, so they are much cheaper an
d
faster to develop than applications that go into production. The code can ignor
e
unimportant details—unimportant to you at the moment, but probably very important to th
e
user later on. If you are prototyping a GUI, for instance, you can get away with incorrec
t
results or data. On the other hand, if you're just investigating computational or performanc
e
aspects, you can get away with a pretty poor GUI, or perhaps even no GUI at all
.
But if you find yourself in an environment where you 
cannot
 give up the details, then you 
need to ask yourself if you are really building a prototype at all. Perhaps a tracer bullet 
style of development would be more appropriate in this case (see 
Tracer Bullets
).
Things to Prototype
What sorts of things might you choose to investigate with a prototype? Anything that 
carries risk. Anything that hasn't been tried before, or that is absolutely critical to the final 
system. Anything unproven, experimental, or doubtful. Anything you aren't comfortable 
 with. You can prototype
Architecture
New functionality in an existing system
Structure or contents of external data
Third-party tools or components
Performance issues
User interface design
Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code produced, but in the 
lessons learned. That's really the point of prototyping.
Tip 16
Prototype to Learn
How to Use Prototypes
When building a prototype, what details can you ignore?
Correctness. 
 
 You may be able to use dummy data where appropriate
.
Completeness. 
 
 The prototype may function only in a very limited sense, perhap
s
with only one preselected piece of input data and one menu item.
Robustness. 
 
 Error checking is likely to be incomplete or missing entirely. If yo
u
stray from the predefined path, the prototype may crash and burn in a glorious 
display of pyrotechnics. That's okay.
Style. 
 
 It is painful to admit this in print, but prototype code probably doesn't hav
e
much in the way of comments or documentation. You may produce reams of 
documentation as a result of your experience with the prototype, but comparatively 
 very little on the prototype system itself.
Since a prototype should gloss over details, and focus in on specific aspects of the syste
m
being considered, you may want to implement prototypes using a very high-leve
l
language—higher than the rest of the project (maybe a language such as Perl, Python, o
r
Tcl). A high-level scripting language lets you defer many details (including specifying dat
a
types) and still produce a functional (albeit incomplete or slow) piece of code
.
[6]
 If you nee
d
to prototype user interfaces, investigate tools such as Tcl/Tk, Visual Basic, Powerbuilder, 
or Delphi.
[6]
 If you are investigating absolute (instead of relative) performance, you will need to stick to a languag
e
that is close in performance to the target language.
Scripting languages work well as the ""glue"" to combine low-level pieces into ne
w
combinations. Under Windows, Visual Basic can glue together COM controls. Mor
e
generally, you can use languages such as Perl and Python to bind together low-level 
C
libraries—either by hand, or automatically with tools such as the freely available SWI
G
[
URL 28
]. Using this approach, you can rapidly assemble existing components into new 
configurations to see how things work.
Prototyping Architecture
Many prototypes are constructed to model the entire system under consideration. A

"Prototyping Architecture
Many prototypes are constructed to model the entire system under consideration. A
s
opposed to tracer bullets, none of the individual modules in the prototype system need t
o
be particularly functional. In fact, you may not even need to code in order to prototyp
e
architecture—you can prototype on a whiteboard, with Post-it notes or index cards. Wha
t
you are looking for is how the system hangs together as a whole, again deferring details
.
Here are some specific areas you may want to look for in the architectural prototype
:
Are the responsibilities of the major components well defined and appropriate?
Are the collaborations between major components well defined?
Is coupling minimized?
Can you identify potential sources of duplication?
Are interface definitions and constraints acceptable?
Does every module have an access path to the data it needs during execution? 
 Does it have that access 
when
 it needs it?
This last item tends to generate the most surprises and the most valuable results from the 
prototyping experience.
How Not to Use Prototypes
Before you embark on any code-based prototyping, make sure that everyone understands 
that you are writing disposable code. Prototypes can be deceptively attractive to people 
who don't know that they are just prototypes. You must make it 
very
 clear that this code is 
disposable, incomplete, and unable to be completed.
It's easy to become misled by the apparent completeness of a demonstrated prototype, 
and project sponsors or management may insist on deploying the prototype (or its progeny) 
if you don't set the right expectations. Remind them that you can build a great prototype of 
a new car out of balsa wood and duct tape, but you wouldn't try to drive it in rush-hour 
traffic!
If you feel there is a strong possibility in your environment or culture that the purpose of 
prototype code may be misinterpreted, you may be better off with the tracer bullet 
approach. You'll end up with a solid framework on which to base future development.
When used properly, a prototype can save you huge amounts of time, money, pain, an
d
suffering by identifying and correcting potential problem spots early in the developmen
t
cycle—the time when fixing mistakes is both cheap and easy
.

Domain Languages
The limits of language are the limits of one's world.
Ludwig Von Wittgenstein
Computer languages influence 
how
 you think about a problem, and how you think abou
t
communicating. Every language comes with a list of features—buzzwords such as stati
c
versus dynamic typing, early versus late binding, inheritance models (single, multiple, o
r
none)—all of which may suggest or obscure certain solutions. Designing a solution wit
h
Lisp in mind will produce different results than a solution based on C-style thinking, an
d
vice versa. Conversely, and we think more importantly, the language of the proble
m
domain may also suggest a programming solution
.
We always try to write code using the vocabulary of the application domain (see 
The 
Requirements Pit
, where we suggest using a project glossary). In some cases, we can g
o
to the next level and actually program using the vocabulary, syntax, and semantics—th
e
language—of the domain
.
When you listen to users of a proposed system, they might be able to tell you exactly how 
the system should work:
Listen for transactions defined by ABC Regulation 12.3 on a set of X.25 
lines, translate them to XYZ Company's format 43B, retransmit them on 
the satellite uplink, and store for future analysis.
If your users have a number of such well-bounded statements, you can invent a 
mini-language tailored to the application domain that expresses exactly what they want:
                               
 
    From X25LINE1 (Format=ABC123) {
      Put TELSTAR1 (Format=XYZ43B);
      Store DB;
    }
This language need not be executable. Initially, it could be simply a way of capturing th
e
user's requirements—a specification. However, you may want to consider taking this a ste
p
further and actually implementing the language. Your specification has become executabl
e
 code
.
After you've written the application, the users give you a new requirement: transactions 
with negative balances shouldn't be stored, and should be sent back on the X.25 lines in 
the original format:
                               
 
    From X25LINE1 (Format=ABC123) {
      if (ABC123.balance < 0) {
        Put X25LINE1 (Format=ABC123);
      }
      else {
        Put TELSTAR1 (Format=XYZ43B);
        Store DB;
      }
    }
That was easy, wasn't it? With the proper support in place, you can program much closer 
to the application domain. We're not suggesting that your end users actually program in 
these languages. Instead, you're giving yourself a tool that lets you work closer to their 
domain.
Tip 17
Program Close to the Problem domain
Whether it's a simple language to configure and control an application program, or a more 
complex language to specify rules or procedures, we think you should consider ways of 
moving your project closer to the problem domain. By coding at a higher level of 
abstraction, you are free to concentrate on solving domain problems, and can ignore petty 
implementation details.
Remember that there are many users of an application. There's the end user, who 
understands the business rules and the required outputs. There are also secondary users: 
operations staff, configuration and test managers, support and maintenance programmers, 
and future generations of developers. Each of these users has their own problem domain, 
and you can generate mini-environments and languages for all of them.
 Domain-Specific Errors
If you are writing in the problem domain, you can also perform domain-specific 
validation, reporting problems in terms your users can understand. Take our 
switching application on on the facing page. Suppose the user misspelled the 
format name:
                                       
 
    From X25LINE1 (Format=AB123)
If this happened in a standard , general-purpose programming language, you 
might receive a standard, general-purpose error message:
                                       
 
    Syntax error: undeclared identifier
But with a mini-launguage, you would instead be able to issue an error message 
using the vocabulary of the domain:

Implementing a Mini-Language
At its simplest, a mini-language may be in a line-oriented, easily parsed format. In practice, 
we probably use this form more than any other. It can be parsed simply using 
switch
statements, or using regular expressions in scripting languages such as Perl. The answer 
to Exercise 5 on page 281 shows a simple implementation in C.
You can also implement a more complex language, with a more formal syntax. The trick 
here is to define the syntax first using a notation such as BNF.
[7]
 Once you have you
r
grammar specified, it is normally trivial to convert it into the input syntax for a parser 
generator. C and C++ programmers have been using 
yacc
 (or its freely available 
implementation, 
bison
 [
URL 27
]) for years. These programs are documented in detail in the 
book 
Lex and Yacc
 [
LMB92
]. Java programmers can try 
javaCC,
 which can be found at 
[
URL 26
]. The answer to Exercise 7 on page 282 shows a parser written using 
bison.
 As it 
shows, once you know the syntax, it's really not a lot of work to write simple 
 mini-languages.
[7]
 BNF, or Backus-Naur Form, lets you specify
 
context-free
 grammars recursively. Any good book on 
compiler construction or parsing will cover BNF in (exhaustive) detail.
There's another way of implementing a mini-language: extend an existing one. For 
example, you could integrate application-level functionality with (say) Python [
URL 9
] and 
write something like
[8]

    record = X25LINE1.get(format=ABC123)
    
if
 (record.balance < 0):
            X25LINE1.put(record, format=ABC123)
    
else:
            TELSTAR1.put(record, format=XYZ43B)
            DB.store(record)
Data Languages and Imperative Languages
The languages you implement can be used in two different ways.
Data languages
 produce some form of data structure used by an application. These 
languages are often used to represent configuration information.
For example, the 
sendmail
 program is used throughout the world for routing e-mail over the 
Internet. It has many excellent features and benefits, which are controlled by a 
thousand-line configuration file, written using 
sendmail
's own configuration language:
                                               
 
    Mlocal, P=/usr/bin/procmail,
            F=lsDFMAw5 :/|@qSPfhn9,
            S=10/30, R=20/40,
            T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
            A=procmail -Y -a $h -d $u
Obviously, readability is not one of 
sendmail
's strengths.
For years, Microsoft has been using a data language that can describe menus, widgets, 
dialog boxes, and other Windows resources. 
Figure 2.2
 on the next page shows an excerpt 
 from a typical resource file. This is far easer to read than the 
sendmail
 example, but it i
s
used in exactly the same way—it is compiled to generate a data structure
.
Figure 2.2. Windows .rc file
Imperative languages
 take this a step further. Here the language is actually executed, and 
so can contain statements, control constructs, and the like (such as the script on page 58).
You can also use your own imperative languages to ease program maintenance. For 
example, you may be asked to integrate information from a legacy application into your 
new GUI development. A common way of achieving this is by 
screen scraping;
 your 
application connects to the mainframe application as if it were a regular human user, 
issuing keystrokes and ""reading"" the responses it gets back. You could script the 
interaction using a mini-language.
[9]
[9]
 In fact, you can buy tools that support just this kind of scripting. You can also investigate open-sourc
e
packages such as Expect, which provide similar capabilities [
URL 24
].
                                               
 
    locate prompt ""SSN:""
    type ""%s"" social_security_number
    type enter
     waitfor keyboardunlock
    if text_at(10,14) is ""INVALID SSN"" return bad_ssn
    if text_at(10,14) is ""DUPLICATE SSN"" return dup_ssn
    # etc...
                                               
 
When the application determines it is time to enter a Social Security number, it invokes the 
interpreter on this script, which then controls the transaction. If the interpreter is embedded 
within the application, the two can even share data directly (for example, via a callback 
mechanism).
Here you're programming in the maintenance programmer's domain. When the mainframe 
application changes, and the fields move around, the programmer can simply update your 
high-level description, rather than groveling around in the details of C code.
Stand-Alone and Embedded Languages
A mini-language doesn't have to be used directly by the application to be useful. Many 
times we may use a specification language to create artifacts (including metadata) that are 
compiled, read-in, or otherwise used by the program itself (see 
Metaprogramming
).
For example, on page 100 we describe a system in which we used Perl to generate a larg
e
number of derivations from an original schema specification. We invented a commo
n
language to express the database schema, and then generated all the forms of it w
e
needed—SQL, C, Web pages, XML, and others. The application didn't use th
e
specification directly, but it relied on the output produced from it
.
It is common to embed high-level imperative languages directly into your application, so 
that they execute when your code runs. This is clearly a powerful capability; you can 
change your application's behavior by changing the scripts it reads, all without compiling. 
This can significantly simplify maintenance in a dynamic application domain.
Easy Development or Easy Maintenance?
We've looked at several different grammars, ranging from simple line-oriented formats to 
more complex grammars that look like real languages. Since it takes extra effort to 
implement, why would you choose a more complex grammar?
 The trade-off is extendibility and maintenance. While the code for parsing a ""real"" languag
e
may be harder to write, it will be much easier for people to understand, and to extend in th
e
future with new features and functionality. Languages that are too simple may be easy t
o
parse, but can be cryptic—much like the
 
sendmail
 example on page 60.
Given that most applications exceed their expected lifetimes, you're probably better off 
biting the bullet and adopting the more complex and readable language up front. The initial 
effort will be repaid many times in reduced support and maintenance costs.

Challenges
Could some of the requirements of your current project be expressed in a 
domain-specific language? Would it be possible to write a compiler or translator 
that could generate most of the code required?
If you decide to adopt mini-languages as a way of programming closer to the 
problem domain, you're accepting that some effort will be required to implement 
them. Can you see ways in which the framework you develop for one project can 
be reused in others?
Exercises

We want to implement a mini-language to control a simple drawing package 
(perhaps a turtle-graphics system). The language consists of single-letter 
commands. Some commands are followed by a single number. For example, 
the following input would draw a rectangle
.
                                                               
 
    P 2 # 
select pen 2
    D   # 
pen down
    W 2 # 
draw west 2cm
    N 1 # 
then north 1
     E 2 # 
then east 2
    S 1 # 
then back south

Estimating
Quick! How long will it take to send 
War and Peace
 over a 56k modem line? How much 
disk space will you need for a million names and addresses? How long does a 1,000-byte 
block take to pass through a router? How many months will it take to deliver your project?
At one level, these are all meaningless questions—they are all missing information. An
d
yet they can all be answered, as long as you are comfortable estimating. And, in th
e
process of producing an estimate, you'll come to understand more about the world you
r
programs inhabit
.
By learning to estimate, and by developing this skill to the point where you have an intuitive 
feel for the magnitudes of things, you will be able to show an apparent magical ability to 
determine their feasibility. When someone says ""we'll send the backup over an ISDN line 
to the central site,"" you'll be able to know intuitively whether this is practical. When you're 
coding, you'll be able to know which subsystems need optimizing and which ones can be 
left alone.
Tip 18
Estimate to Avoid Surprises
As a bonus, at the end of this section we'll reveal the single correct answer to give 
whenever anyone asks you for an estimate.
How Accurate Is Accurate Enough?
To some extent, all answers are estimates. It's just that some are more accurate than 
others. So the first question you have to ask yourself when someone asks you for an 
estimate is the context in which your answer will be taken. Do they need high accuracy, or 
are they looking for a ballpark figure?
If your grandmother asks when you will arrive, she's probably wondering whether to 
 make you lunch or dinner. On the other hand, a diver trapped underwater and 
running out of air is probably interested in an answer down to the second.
What's the value of p? If you're wondering how much edging to buy to put around a 
circular flower bed, then ""3"" is probably good enough.
[10]
 If you're in school, the
n
maybe ""22/7"" is a good approximation. If you're in NASA, then maybe 12 decimal 
places will do.
[10]
 ""3"" is also apparently good enough if you are a legislator. In 1897, Indiana Stat
e
Legislature House Bill No. 246 attempted to decree that henceforth p should have the value of 
""3"". The Bill was tabled indefinitely at its second reading when a mathematics professor 
pointed out that their powers did not quite extend to passing laws of nature.
One of the interesting things about estimating is that the units you use make a difference in 
the interpretation of the result. If you say that something will take about 130 working days, 
then people will be expecting it to come in pretty close. However, if you say ""Oh, about six 
months,"" then they know to look for it any time between five and seven months from now. 
Both numbers represent the same duration, but ""130 days"" probably implies a higher 
degree of accuracy than you feel. We recommend that you scale time estimates as follows:
Duration
Quote estimate in
1-15 days
days
3-8 weeks
weeks
8-30 weeks
months
30+ weeks
think hard before giving an estimate
So, if after doing all the necessary work, you decide that a project will take 125 working 
days (25 weeks), you might want to deliver an estimate of ""about six months.""
The same concepts apply to estimates of any quantity: choose the units of your answer to 
reflect the accuracy you intend to convey.
Where Do Estimates Come From?
All estimates are based on models of the problem. But before we get too deeply into the 
techniques of building models, we have to mention a basic estimating trick that always 
gives good answers: ask someone who's already done it. Before you get too committed to 
model building, cast around for someone who's been in a similar situation in the past.
See how their problem got solved. It's unlikely you'll ever find an exact match, but you'd be 
 surprised how many times you can successfully draw on other's experiences.
Understand What's Being Asked
The first part of any estimation exercise is building an understanding of what's being asked. 
As well as the accuracy issues discussed above, you need to have a grasp of the scope of 
the domain. Often this is implicit in the question, but you need to make it a habit to think 
about the scope before starting to guess. Often, the scope you choose will form part of the 
answer you give: ""Assuming there are no traffic accidents and there's gas in the car, I 
should be there in 20 minutes.""
Build a Model of the System
This is the fun part of estimating. From your understanding of the question being asked, 
build a rough and ready bare-bones mental model. If you're estimating response times, 
your model may involve a server and some kind of arriving traffic. For a project, the model 
may be the steps that your organization uses during development, along with a very rough 
picture of how the system might be implemented.
Model building can be both creative and useful in the long term. Often, the process of 
building the model leads to discoveries","[-0.0113570625, 0.015327969, 0.038895905, -0.018146904, -0.0071151047, -0.0028070782, -0.015192443, 0.0012790248, -0.0054481374, 0.06554028, 0.078496546,

" creative and useful in the long term. Often, the process of 
building the model leads to discoveries of underlying patterns and processes that weren't 
apparent on the surface. You may even want to reexamine the original question: ""You 
asked for an estimate to do 
X.
 However, it looks like 
Y,
 a variant of 
X,
 could be done in 
about half the time, and you lose only one feature.""
Building the model introduces inaccuracies into the estimating process. This is inevitable, 
and also beneficial. You are trading off model simplicity for accuracy. Doubling the effort on 
the model may give you only a slight increase in accuracy. Your experience will tell you 
when to stop refining.
Break the Model into Components
Once you have a model, you can decompose it into components. You'll need to discover 
the mathematical rules that describe how these components interact. Sometimes a 
component contributes a single value that is added into the result. Some components may 
supply multiplying factors, while others may be more complicated (such as those that 
simulate the arrival of traffic at a node).
You'll find that each component will typically have parameters that affect how it contributes 
 to the overall model. At this stage, simply identify each parameter.
Give Each Parameter a Value
Once you have the parameters broken out, you can go through and assign each one a 
value. You expect to introduce some errors in this step. The trick is to work out which 
parameters have the most impact on the result, and concentrate on getting them about 
right. Typically, parameters whose values are added into a result are less significant than 
those that are multiplied or divided. Doubling a line speed may double the amount of data 
received in an hour, while adding a 5 ms transit delay will have no noticeable effect.
You should have a justifiable way of calculating these critical parameters. For the queuing 
example, you might want to measure the actual transaction arrival rate of the existing 
system, or find a similar system to measure. Similarly, you could measure the current time 
taken to serve a request, or come up with an estimate using the techniques described in 
this section. In fact, you'll often find yourself basing an estimate on other subestimates. 
This is where your largest errors will creep in.
Calculate the Answers
Only in the simplest of cases will an estimate have a single answer. You might be happy to 
say ""I can walk five cross-town blocks in 15 minutes."" However, as the systems get more 
complex, you'll want to hedge your answers. Run multiple calculations, varying the values 
of the critical parameters, until you work out which ones really drive the model. A 
spreadsheet can be a big help. Then couch your answer in terms of these parameters. 
""The response time is roughly three quarters of a second if the system has a SCSI bus and 
64MB memory, and one second with 48MB memory."" (Notice how ""three quarters of a 
second"" conveys a different feeling of accuracy than 750 ms.)
During the calculation phase, you may start getting answers that seem strange. Don't be 
too quick to dismiss them. If your arithmetic is correct, your understanding of the problem 
or your model is probably wrong. This is valuable information.
Keep Track of Your Estimating Prowess
We think it's a great idea to record your estimates so you can see how close you were. I
f
an overall estimate involved calculating subestimates, keep track of these as well. Ofte
n
you'll find your estimates are pretty good—in fact, after a while, you'll come to expect this
.
 When an estimate turns out wrong, don't just shrug and walk away. Find out why it differed 
from your guess. Maybe you chose some parameters that didn't match the reality of the 
problem. Maybe your model was wrong. Whatever the reason, take some time to uncover 
what happened. If you do, your next estimate will be better.
Estimating Project Schedules
The normal rules of estimating can break down in the face of the complexities and vagaries 
of a sizable application development. We find that often the only way to determine the 
timetable for a project is by gaining experience on that same project. This needn't be a 
paradox if you practice incremental development, repeating the following steps.
Check requirements
Analyze risk
Design, implement, integrate
Validate with the users
Initially, you may have only a vague idea of how many iterations will be required, or how 
long they may be. Some methods require you to nail this down as part of the initial plan, 
but for all but the most trivial of projects this is a mistake. Unless you are doing an 
application similar to a previous one, with the same team and the same technology, you'd 
just be guessing.
So you complete the coding and testing of the initial functionality and mark this as the end 
of the first increment. Based on that experience, you can refine your initial guess on the 
number of iterations and what can be included in each. The refinement gets better and 
better each time, and confidence in the schedule grows along with it.
Tip 19
Iterate the Schedule with the Code
This may not be popular with management, who typically want a single, hard-and-fast 
 number before the project even starts. You'll have to help them understand that the team, 
their productivity, and the environment will determine the schedule. By formalizing this, and 
refining the schedule as part of each iteration, you'll be giving them the most accurate 
scheduling estimates you can.
What to Say When Asked for an Estimate
You say ""
I'll get back to you.
""
You almost always get better results if you slow the process down and spend some time 
going through the steps we describe in this section. Estimates given at the coffee machine 
will (like the coffee) come back to haunt you.

Challenges
Start keeping a log of your estimates. For each, track how accurate you turned out 
to be. If your error was greater than 50%, try to find out where your estimate went 
wrong.

You are asked ""Which has a higher bandwidth: a 1Mbps communications line 
or a person walking between two computers with a full 4GB tape in their 
pocket?"" What constraints will you put on your answer to ensure that the 
scope of your response is correct? (For example, you might say that the time 
taken to access the tape is ignored.)

Chapter 3. The Basic Tool

Every craftsman starts his or her journey with a basic set of good-quality tools. A 
woodworker might need rules, gauges, a couple of saws, some good planes, fine chisels, 
drills and braces, mallets, and clamps. These tools will be lovingly chosen, will be built to 
last, will perform specific jobs with little overlap with other tools, and, perhaps most 
importantly, will feel right in the budding woodworker's hands.
Then begins a process of learning and adaptation.

"worker's hands.
Then begins a process of learning and adaptation. Each tool will have its own personalit
y
and quirks, and will need its own special handling. Each must be sharpened in a uniqu
e
way, or held just so. Over time, each will wear according to use, until the grip looks like 
a
mold of the woodworker's hands and the cutting surface aligns perfectly with the angle a
t
which the tool is held. At this point, the tools become conduits from the craftsman's brain t
o
the finished product—they have become extensions of his or her hands. Over time, th
e
woodworker will add new tools, such as biscuit cutters, laser-guided miter saws, dovetai
l
jigs—all wonderful pieces of technology. But you can bet that he or she will be happies
t
with one of those original tools in hand, feeling the plane sing as it slides through the wood
.
Tools amplify your talent. The better your tools, and the better you know how to use them, 
the more productive you can be. Start with a basic set of generally applicable tools. As you 
gain experience, and as you come across special requirements, you'll add to this basic set. 
Like the craftsman, expect to add to your toolbox regularly. Always be on the lookout for 
better ways of doing things. If you come across a situation where you feel your current 
tools can't cut it, make a note to look for something different or more powerful that would 
have helped. Let need drive your acquisitions.
Many new programmers make the mistake of adopting a single power tool, such as a 
particular integrated development environment (IDE), and never leave its cozy interface. 
This really is a mistake. We need to be comfortable beyond the limits imposed by an IDE. 
The only way to do this is to keep the basic tool set sharp and ready to use.
In this chapter we'll talk about investing in your own basic toolbox. As with any good 
discussion on tools, we'll start (in 
The Power of Plain Text
) by looking at your raw 
materials, the stuff you'll be shaping. From there we'll move to the workbench, or in our 
case the computer. How can you use your computer to get the most out of the tools you 
use? We'll discuss this in 
Shell Games.
 Now that we have material and a bench to work 
on, we'll turn to the tool you'll probably use more than any other, your editor. In 
Power 
 Editing,
 we'll suggest ways of making you more efficient.
To ensure that we never lose any of our precious work, we should always use a 
Source 
Code Control
 system—even for things such as our personal address book! And, since Mr
.
Murphy was really an optimist after all, you can't be a great programmer until you becom
e
highly skilled at
 
Debugging.
You'll need some glue to bind much of the magic together. We discuss some possibilities, 
such as awk, Perl, and Python, in 
Text Manipulation.
Just as woodworkers sometimes build jigs to guide the construction of complex pieces, 
programmers can write code that itself writes code. We discuss this in 
Code Generators.
Spend time learning to use these tools, and at some point you'll be surprised to discover 
your fingers moving over the keyboard, manipulating text without conscious thought. The 
tools will have become extensions of your hands.

The Power of Plain Text
As Pragmatic Programmers, our base material isn't wood or iron, it's knowledge. We 
gather requirements as knowledge, and then express that knowledge in our designs, 
implementations, tests, and documents. And we believe that the best format for storing 
knowledge persistently is 
plain text.
 With plain text, we give ourselves the ability to 
manipulate knowledge, both manually and programmatically, using virtually every tool at 
our disposal.
What Is Plain Text?
Plain text
 is made up of printable characters in a form that can be read and understood 
directly by people. For example, although the following snippet is made up of printable 
characters, it is meaningless.
                                       
 
Fieldl9=467abe
The reader has no idea what the significance of 
467abe
 may be. A better choice would be 
to make it 
understandable
 to humans.
                                       
 
DrawingType=UMLActivityDrawing
Plain text doesn't mean that the text is unstructured; XML, SGML, and HTML are great 
examples of plain text that has a well-defined structure. You can do everything with plain 
text that you could do with some binary format, including versioning.
Plain text tends to be at a higher level than a straight binary encoding, which is usually 
derived directly from the implementation. Suppose you wanted to store a property called 
uses_menus
 that can be either 
TRUE
 or 
FALSE.
 Using text, you might write this as
                                       
 
myprop.uses_menus=FALSE
Contrast this with 
0010010101110101.
The problem with most binary formats is that the context necessary to understand the data 
 is separate from the data itself. You are artificially divorcing the data from its meaning. The 
data may as well be encrypted; it is absolutely meaningless without the application logic to 
parse it. With plain text, however, you can achieve a self-describing data stream that is 
independent of the application that created it.
Tip 20
Keep Knowledge in Plain Text
Drawbacks
There are two major drawbacks to using plain text: (1) It may take more space to store than 
a compressed binary format, and (2) it may be computationally more expensive to interpret 
and process a plain text file.
Depending on your application, either or both of these situations may be unacceptable—fo
r
example, when storing satellite telemetry data, or as the internal format of a relationa
l
database
.
But even in these situations, it may be acceptable to store 
metadata
 about the raw data in 
plain text (see 
Metaprogramming
).
Some developers may worry that by putting metadata in plain text, they're exposing it to 
the system's users. This fear is misplaced. Binary data may be more obscure than plain 
text, but it is no more secure. If you worry about users seeing passwords, encrypt them. If 
you don't want them changing configuration parameters, include a 
secure hash
[1]
 of all th
e
parameter values in the file as a checksum.
[1]
 MD5 is often used for this purpose. For an excellent introduction to the wonderful world o
f
cryptography, see [
Sch95

Human-readable forms of data, and self-describing data, will outlive all other forms of data

As long as the data survives, you will have a chance to be able to use it—potentially lon

You can parse such a file with only partial knowledge of its format; with most binary files, 
you must know all the details of the entire format in order to parse it successfully.
Consider a data file from some legacy system

Leverage
Virtually every tool in the computing universe, from source code management systems to 
compiler environments to editors and stand-alone filters, can operate on plain text.
The Unix Philosophy
Unix is famous for being designed around the philosophy of small, sharp tools
,
each intended to do one thing well. This philosphy is enabled by using 
a
common underlying format—the line-oriented, plain text file. Databases used fo
r
system administration (users and passwords, networking configuration, and s
o
on) are all kept as plain text files. (some systems, such as Solaris, also maintai
n
a binary forms of certain databases as a performance optimization. The plain tex
t
version is kept as an interface to the binary version.
)
When a system crashes, you may be faced with only a minimal environment to 
restore it (You may not be able to access graphics drivers, for instance), 
Situations such as this can really make you appreciate the simplicity of plain text.
For instance, suppose you have a production deployment of a large application with a 
complex site-specific configuration file (
sendmail
 comes to mind). If this file is in plain text, 
you could place it under a source code control system (see 
Source Code Control
), so that 
you automatically keep a history of all changes. File comparison tools such as 
diff
 and 
fc
allow you to see at a glance what changes have been made, while 
sum
 allows you to 
generate a checksum to monitor the file for accidental (or malicious) modification.
 Easier Testing
If you use plain text to create synthetic data to drive system tests, then it is a simple matter 
to add, update, or modify the test data 
without having to create any special tools to do 
so.
 Similarly, plain text output from regression tests can be trivially analyzed (with 
diff,
 for 
instance) or subjected to more thorough scrutiny with Perl, Python, or some other scripting 
tool.
Lowest Common Denominator
Even in the future of XML-based intelligent agents that travel the wild and dangerous 
Internet autonomously, negotiating data interchange among themselves, the ubiquitous 
text file will still be there. In fact, in heterogeneous environments the advantages of plain 
text can outweigh all of the drawbacks. You need to ensure that all parties can 
communicate using a common standard. Plain text is that standard.

Shell Games
Every woodworker needs a good, solid, reliable workbench, somewhere to hold work 
pieces at a convenient height while he or she works them. The workbench becomes the 
center of the wood shop, the craftsman returning to it time and time again as a piece takes 
shape.
For a programmer manipulating files of text, that workbench is the command shell. From 
the shell prompt, you can invoke your full repertoire of tools, using pipes to combine them 
in ways never dreamt of by their original developers. From the shell, you can launch 
applications, debuggers, browsers, editors, and utilities. You can search for files, query the 
status of the system, and filter output. And by programming the shell, you can build 
complex macro commands for activities you perform often.
For programmers raised on GUI interfaces and integrated development environments 
(IDEs), this might seem an extreme position. After all, can't you do everything equally well 
by pointing and clicking?
The simple answer is ""no."" GUI interfaces are wonderful, and they can be faster and more 
convenient for some simple operations. Moving files, reading MIME-encoded e-mail, and 
typing letters are all things that you might want to do in a graphical environment. But if you 
do all your work using GUIs, you are missing out on the full capabilities of your 
environment. You won't be able to automate common tasks, or use the full power of the 
tools available to you. And you won't be able to combine your tools to create customized 
macro tools
. A benefit of GUIs is WYSIWYG—what you see is what you get. Th
e
disadvantage is WYSIAYG—what you see is
 
all
 you get.

" or develop object models, or write documentation, or automate the buil
d
process—we do
 
all
 of these things. The scope of any one tool is usually limited to the tasks 
that the tool is expected to perform. For instance, suppose you need to integrate a code 
preprocessor (to implement design-by-contract, or multi-processing pragmas, or some 
such) into your IDE. Unless the designer of the IDE explicitly provided hooks for this 
capability, you can't do it.
 You may already be comfortable working from the command prompt, in which case you 
can safely skip this section. Otherwise, you may need to be convinced that the shell is your 
friend.
As a Pragmatic Programmer, you will constantly want to perform ad ho
c
operations—things that the GUI may not support. The command line is better suited whe
n
you want to quickly combine a couple of commands to perform a query or some other task
.
Here are a few examples
.
Find all
 .
c
 
files modified more recently than your Makefile.
Shell
…
find . -name ' *.c' -newer Makefile -print
GUI….
.
Open the Explorer, navigate to the correct directory, click on the Makefile, and note the 
modification time. Then bring up Tools/Find, and enter 
*.c
 for the file specification. Select the 
date tab, and enter the date you noted for the Makefile in the first date field. Then hit OK
.
Construct a zip/tar archive of my source.
Shell
…
zip archive.zip *.h *.c      -
or
-
tar cvf archive.tar *.h *.c
GUI….
.
Bring up a ZIP utility (such as the shareware WinZip [
URL 41
], select ""Create New Archive,"" 
enter its name, select the source directory in the add dialog, set the filter to 
""* .c"",
 click ""Add,"" 
set the filter to 
""* .h"",
 click ""Add,"" then close the archive.
¨
Which Java files have not been changed in the last week?
Shell
…
find . -name '*.java' -mtime +7 -print
GUI….
.
Click and navigate to ""Find files,"" click the ""Named"" field and type in ""*.java"", select the ""Date 
Modified"" tab. Then select ""Between."" Click on the starting date and type in the starting date 
of the beginning of the project. Click on the ending date and type in the date of a week ago 
today (be sure to have a calendar handy). Click on ""Find Now.""
Of those files, which use the
 
awt
 
libraries?
 Shell
…
find . -name '*.java' -mtime +7 -print |
     xargs grep 'java.awt'
GUI….
.
Load each file in the list from the previous example into an editor and search for the string 
""java.awt"". Write down the name of each file containing a match.
Clearly the list could go on. The shell commands may be obscure or terse, but they are 
powerful and concise. And, because shell commands can be combined into script files (or 
command files under Windows systems), you can build sequences of commands to 
automate things you do often.
Tip 21
Use the Power of Command Shells
Gain familiarity with the shell, and you'll find your productivity soaring. Need to create a list 
of all the unique package names explicitly imported by your Java code? The following 
stores it in a file called ""list.""
                               
 
    grep '^import ' *.java |
      sed -e's/.*import  *//' -e's/;.*$//' |
      sort -u >list
If you haven't spent much time exploring the capabilities of the command shell on the 
systems you use, this might appear daunting. However, invest some energy in becoming 
familiar with your shell and things will soon start falling into place. Play around with your 
command shell, and you'll be surprised at how much more productive it makes you.
Shell Utilities and Windows Systems
Although the command shells provided with Windows systems are improving gradually, 
Windows command-line utilities are still inferior to their Unix counterparts. However, all is 
not lost.
Cygnus Solutions has a package called Cygwin [
URL 31
]. As well as providing a Unix 
 compatibility layer for Windows, Cygwin comes with a collection of more than 120 Unix 
utilities, including such favorites as 
1s, grep,
 and 
find.
 The utilities and libraries may be 
downloaded and used for free, but be sure to read their license.
[3]
 The Cygwin distributio
n
comes with the Bash shell.
[3]
 The GNU General Public License 
[
URL 57
] is a kind of legal virus that Open Source developers use t
o
protect their (and your) rights. You should spend some time reading it. In essence, it says that you ca
n
use and modify GPL'd software, but if you distribute any modifications they must be licensed according t
o
the GPL (and marked as such), and you must make source available. That's the virus part—wheneve
r
you derive a work from a GPL'd work, your derived work must also be GPL'd. However, it does not limi
t
you in any way when simply using the tools—the ownership and licensing of software developed usin
g
the tools are up to you
.
Using Unix Tools Under Windows
We love the availability of high-quality Unix tools under Windows, and use them 
daily. However, be aware that there are integration issues. Unlike their Ms-dos 
counterparts, these utilities are sensitive to the case of filenames, so 
ls a*.bat
won't find 
AUTOEXEC.BAT.
 You may also come across problems with filenames 
containing spaces, and with differences in path separators. Finally, there are 
interesting problems when running Ms-dos programs that expect Ms-DOS-style 
arguments under the Unix shells, For examples, the Java utilities from JavaSoft 
use a colon as their CLASSPATH separators under Unix, but use a semicolon 
under MS-DOS. As a result, a Bash or ksh script that runs on a Unix box will run 
identically under Windows, but the command line it passes to Java will be 
interpreted incorrectly.
Alternatively, David Korn (of Korn shell fame) has put together a package called uwin. Thi
s
has the same aims as the Cygwin distribution—it is a Unix development environment unde
r
Windows. UWIN comes with a version of the Korn shell. Commercial versions are availabl
e
from Global Technologies, Ltd. 
[
URL 30
]. In addition, AT&T allows free downloading of the 
package for evaluation and academic use. Again, read their license before using.
Finally, Tom Christiansen is (at the time of writing) putting together 
Perl Power Tools,
 an 
attempt to implement all the familiar Unix utilities portably, in Perl [

Power Editing
We've talked before about tools being an extension of your hand. Well, this applies to 
editors more than to any other software tool. You need to be able to manipulate text as 
effortlessly as possible, because text is the basic raw material of programming. Let's look 
at some common features and functions that help you get the most from your editing 
environment.
One Editor
We think it is better to know one editor very well, and use it for all editing tasks: code, 
documentation, memos, system administration, and so on. Without a single editor, you face 
a potential modern day Babel of confusion. You may have to use the built-in editor in each 
language's IDE for coding, and an all-in-one office product for documentation, and maybe a 
different built-in editor for sending e-mail. Even the keystrokes you use to edit command 
lines in the shell may be different.
[4]
 It is difficult to be proficient in any of thes
e
environments if you have a different set of editing conventions and commands in each.
[4]
 Ideally, the shell you use should have keybindings that match the ones used by your editor. Bash, fo
r
instance, supports both 
vi
 and 
emacs
 keybindings.
You need to be proficient. Simply typing linearly and using a mouse to cut and paste is not 
enough. You just can't be as effective that way as you can with a powerful editor under 
your fingers. Typing 
 or 
 ten times to move the cursor left to the 
beginning of a line isn't as efficient as typing a single key such as 
 
 or 
.
Tip 22
Use a Single Editor Well
Choose an editor, know it thoroughly, and use it for all editing tasks. If you use a single 
 editor (or set of keybindings) across all text editing activities, you don't have to stop and 
think to accomplish text manipulation: the necessary keystrokes will be a reflex. The editor 
will be an extension of your hand; the keys will sing as they slice their way through text and 
thought. That's our goal.
Make sure that the editor you choose is available on all platforms you use. Emacs, vi, 
CRiSP, Brief, and others are available across multiple platforms, often in both GUI and 
non-GUI (text screen) versions.
Editor Features
Beyond whatever features you find particularly useful and comfortable, here are some 
basic abilities that we think every decent editor should have. If your editor falls short in any 
of these areas, then this may be the time to consider moving on to a more advanced one.
Configurable. 
 
 All aspects of the editor should be configurable to you
r
preferences, including fonts, colors, window sizes, and keystroke bindings (which 
keys perform what commands). Using only keystrokes for common editing 
operations is more efficient than mouse or menu-driven commands, because your 
hands never leave the keyboard.
Extensible. 
 
 An editor shouldn't be obsolete just because a new programmin
g
language comes out. It should be able to integrate with whatever compiler 
environment you are using. You should be able to ""teach"" it the nuances of any 
new language or text format (XML, HTML version 9, and so on).
Programmable. 
 
 You should be able to program the editor to perform complex
,
multistep tasks. This can be done with macros or with a built-in scripting 
programming language (Emacs uses a variant of Lisp, for instance).
In addition, many editors support features that are specific to a particular programming 
language, such as:
Syntax highlighting
Auto-completion
Auto-indentation
Initial code or document boilerplate
 Tie-in to help systems
IDE-like features (compile, debug, and so on)
A feature such as syntax highlighting may sound like a frivolous extra, but in reality it can 
be very useful and enhance your productivity. Once you get used to seeing keywords 
appear in a different color or font, a mistyped keyword that 
doesn't
 appear that way jumps 
out at you long before you fire up the compiler.
Having the ability to compile and navigate directly to errors within the editor environment is 
very handy on big projects. Emacs in particular is adept at this style of interaction.
Productivity
A surprising number of people we've met use the Windows 
notepad
 utility to edit thei
r
source code. This is like using a teaspoon as a shovel—simply typing and using basi
c
mouse-based cut and paste is not enough
.
What sort of things will you need to do that 
can't
 be done in this way?
Well, there's cursor movement, to start with. Single keystrokes that move you in units of 
words, lines, blocks, or functions are far more efficient than repeatedly typing a keystroke 
that moves you character by character or line by line.
Or suppose you are writing Java code. You like to keep your 
import
 statements in 
alphabetical order, and someone else has checked in a few files that don't adhere to this 
standard (this may sound extreme, but on a large project it can save you a lot of time 
scanning through a long list of 
import
 statements). You'd like to go quickly through a few 
files and sort a small section of them. In editors such as vi and Emacs you can do this 
easily (see 
Figure 3.1
). Try 
that
 in 
notepad.
Figure 3.1. Sorting lines in an editor
Some editors can help streamline common operations. For instance, when you create a 
new file in a particular language, the editor can supply a template for you. It might include:
 Name of the class or module filled in (derived from the filename)
Your name and/or copyright statements
Skeletons for constructs in that language (constructor and destructor declarations, 
for example)
Another useful feature is auto-indenting. Rather than having to indent manually (by using 
space or tab), the editor automatically indents for you at the appropriate time (after typing 
an open brace, for example). The nice part about this feature is that you can use the editor 
to provide a consistent indentation style for your project.

 The Linux kernel is developed this way. Here you have geographically dispersed developers, man
y
working on the same pieces of code. There is a published list of settings (in this case, for Emacs) that 
describes the required indentation style.
Where to Go from Here
This sort of advice is particularly hard to write because virtually every reader is at a 
different level of comfort and expertise with the editor(s) they are currently using. So, to

What Editors Are Available?
Having recommended that you master a decent editor, which one do we recommend? 
Well, we're going to duck that question; your choice of editor is a personal one (some 
would even say a religious one!). However, in 
Appendix A
, we list a number of popular 
 editors and where to get them.
Challenges
Some editors use full-blown languages for customization and scripting. Emacs, for 
example, uses Lisp. As one of the new languages you are going to learn this year, 
learn the language your editor uses. For anything you find yourself doing 
repeatedly, develop a set of macros (or equivalent) to handle it.
Do you know everything your editor is capable of doing? Try to stump your 
colleagues who use the same editor. Try to accomplish any given editing task in as 
few keystrokes as possible.

Source Code Control
Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. Those who cannot 
remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
George Santayana,
 Life of Reason
One of the important things we look for in a user interface is the 
 key—a singl
e
button that forgives us our mistakes. It's even better if the environment supports multipl
e
levels of undo and redo, so you can go back and recover from something that happened 
a
couple of minutes ago. But what if the mistake happened last week, and you've turned you
r
computer on and off ten times since then? Well, that's one of the many benefits of using 
a
source code control system: it's a giant
 
 key—a project-wide time machine tha
t
can return you to those halcyon days of last week, when the code actually compiled an
d
ran
.
Source code control systems, or the more widely scoped 
configuration management
systems, keep track of every change you make in your source code and documentation. 
The better ones can keep track of compiler and OS versions as well. With a properly 
configured source code control system, 
you can always go back to a previous version of 
your software.
But a source code control system (SCCS
[6]
 ) does far more than undo mistakes. A goo
d
SCCS will let you track changes, answering questions such as: Who made changes in this 
line of code? What's the difference between the current version and last week's? How 
many lines of code did we change in this release? Which files get changed most often? 
This kind of information is invaluable for bug-tracking, audit, performance, and quality 
purposes.
[6]
 We use the uppercase SCCS to refer to generic source code control systems. There is also a specifi
c
system called ""sccs,"" originally released with AT&T System V Unix.
An SCCS will also let you identify releases of your software. Once identified, you will 
always be able to go back and regenerate the release, independent of changes that may 
have occurred later.
We often use an SCCS to manage branches in the development tree. For example, once 
 you have released some software, you'll normally want to continue developing for the next 
release. At the same time, you'll need to deal with bugs in the current release, shipping 
fixed versions to clients. You'll want these bug fixes rolled into the next release (if 
appropriate), but you don't want to ship code under development to clients. With an SCCS 
you can generate branches in the development tree each time you generate a release. You 
apply bug fixes to code in the branch, and continue developing on the main trunk. Since 
the bug fixes may be relevant to the main trunk as well, some systems allow you to merge 
selected changes from the branch back into the main trunk automatically.
Source code control systems may keep the files they maintain in a central repository—
a
great candidate for archiving
.
Finally, some products may allow two or more users to be working concurrently on the 
same set of files, even making concurrent changes in the same file. The system then 
manages the merging of these changes when the files are sent back to the repository. 
Although seemingly risky, such systems work well in practice on projects of all sizes.
Tip 23
Always Use Source Code Control
Always. Even if you are a single-person team on a one-week project. Even if it's a 
""throw-away"" prototype. Even if the stuff you're working on isn't source code. Make sure 
that 
everything
 is under source code control—documentation, phone number lists, memo
s
to vendors, makefiles, build and release procedures, that little shell script that burns the C
D
master—everything. We routinely use source code control on just about everything w
e
type (including the text of this book). Even if we're not working on a project, our day-to-da
y
work is secured in a repository
.
Source Code Control and Builds
There is a tremendous hidden benefit in having an entire project under the umbrella of a 
source code control system: you can have product builds that are 
automatic
 and 
repeatable.
 The project build mechanism can pull the latest source out of the repository automatically
.
It can run in the middle of the night after everyone's (hopefully) gone home. You can ru
n
automatic regression tests to ensure that the day's coding didn't break anything. Th
e
automation of the build ensures consistency—there are no manual procedures, and yo
u
won't need developers remembering to copy code into some special build area
.
The build is repeatable because you can always rebuild the source as it existed on a given 
date.

But My Team Isn't Using Source Code Control
Shame on them! Sounds like an opportunity to do some evangelizing! However, while you 
wait for them to see the light, perhaps you should implement your own private source 
control. Use one of the freely available tools we list in 
Appendix A
, and make a point of

"keeping your personal work safely tucked into a repository (as well as doing whatever your 
project requires). Although this may seem to be duplication of effort, we can pretty much 
guarantee it will save you grief (and save your project money) the first time you need to 
answer questions such as ""What did you do to the 
xyz
 module?"" and ""What broke the 
build?"" This approach may also help convince your management that source code control 
really works.
Don't forget that an SCCS is equally applicable to the things you do outside of work.

Even if you are not able to use an SCCS at work, install RCS or CVS on a personal 
system. Use it to manage your pet projects, documents you write, and (possibly) 
configuration changes applied to the computer system itself.

Debugging
It is a painful thing
To look at your own trouble and know
That you yourself and no one else has made it
Sophocles, 
Ajax
The word 
bug
 has been used to describe an ""object of terror"" ever since the fourteenth 
century. Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper, the inventor of COBOL, is credited with 
observing the first 
computer bug
—
literally, a moth caught in a relay in an early compute
r
system. When asked to explain why the machine wasn't behaving as intended, 
a
technician reported that there was ""a bug in the system,"" and dutifully taped it—wings an
d
all—into the log book
.
Regrettably, we still have ""bugs"" in the system, albeit not the flying kind. But the fourteent
h
century meaning—a bogeyman—is perhaps even more applicable now than it was then
.
Software defects manifest themselves in a variety of ways, from misunderstoo
d
requirements to coding errors. Unfortunately, modern computer systems are still limited t
o
doing what you
 
tell
 them to do, not necessarily what you 
want
 them to do.
No one writes perfect software, so it's a given that debugging will take up a major portion of 
your day. Let's look at some of the issues involved in debugging and some general 
strategies for finding elusive bugs.
Psychology of Debugging
Debugging itself is a sensitive, emotional subject for many developers. Instead of attacking 
it as a puzzle to be solved, you may encounter denial, finger pointing, lame excuses, or just 
plain apathy.
Embrace the fact that debugging is just 
problem solving,
 and attack it as such.
Having found someone else's bug, you can spend time and energy laying blame on the 
filthy culprit who created it. In some workplaces this is part of the culture, and may be 
 cathartic. However, in the technical arena, you want to concentrate on fixing the 
problem,
not the blame.
Tip 24
Fix the Problem, Not the Blame
It doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else's. It is still your 
problem.
A Debugging Mindset
The easiest person to deceive is one's self
Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 
The Disowned
Before you start debugging, it's important to adopt the right mindset. You need to turn off 
many of the defenses you use each day to protect your ego, tune out any project 
pressures you may be under, and get yourself comfortable. Above all, remember the first 
rule of debugging:
Tip 25
Don't Panic
It's easy to get into a panic, especially if you are facing a deadline, or have a nervous boss 
or client breathing down your neck while you are trying to find the cause of the bug. But it is 
very important to step back a pace, and actually 
think
 about what could be causing the 
symptoms that you believe indicate a bug.
If your first reaction on witnessing a bug or seeing a bug report is ""that's impossible,"" you 
are plainly wrong. Don't waste a single neuron on the train of thought that begins ""but that 
 can't happen"" because quite clearly it 
can,
 and has.
Beware of myopia when debugging. Resist the urge to fix just the symptoms you see: it is 
more likely that the actual fault may be several steps removed from what you are 
observing, and may involve a number of other related things. Always try to discover the 
root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.
Where to Start
Before you 
start
 to look at the bug, make sure that you are working on code that compile
d
cleanly—without warnings. We routinely set compiler warning levels as high as possible. I
t
doesn't make sense to waste time trying to find a problem that the compiler could find fo
r
you! We need to concentrate on the harder problems at hand
.
When trying to solve any problem, you need to gather all the relevant data. Unfortunately, 
bug reporting isn't an exact science. It's easy to be misled by coincidences, and you can't 
afford to waste time debugging coincidences. You first need to be accurate in your 
observations.
Accuracy in bug reports is further diminished when they come through a third party—yo
u
may actually need to
 
watch
 the user who reported the bug in action to get a sufficient level 
of detail.
Andy once worked on a large graphics application. Nearing release, the testers reported 
that the application crashed every time they painted a stroke with a particular brush. The 
programmer responsible argued that there was nothing wrong with it; he had tried painting 
with it, and it worked just fine. This dialog went back and forth for several days, with 
tempers rapidly rising.
Finally, we got them together in the same room. The tester selected the brush tool and 
painted a stroke from the upper right corner to the lower left corner. The application 
exploded. ""Oh,"" said the programmer, in a small voice, who then sheepishly admitted that 
he had made test strokes only from the lower left to the upper right, which did not expose 
the bug.
There are two points to this story:
You may need to interview the user who reported the bug in order to gather more 
data than you were initially given.
 Artificial tests (such as the programmer's single brush stroke from bottom to top)

 Artificial tests (such as the programmer's single brush stroke from bottom to top) 
don't exercise enough of an application. You must brutally test both boundary 
conditions and realistic end-user usage patterns. You need to do this systematically 
(see 
Ruthless Testing
).
Debugging Strategies
Once 
you
 think you know what is going on, it's time to find out what the 
program
 thinks is 
going on.
Bug Reproduction
No, our bugs aren't really multiplying (although some of them are probably old 
enough to do it legally). We're talking about a different kind of reproduction.
The best way to start fixing a bug is to make it reproducible. After all, if you can't 
reproduce it, how will you know if it is ever fixed?
But we want more than a bug that can be reproduced by following some long 
series of steps; we want a bug that can be reproduced with a 
single command.
It's a lot harder to fix a bug if you have to go through 15 steps to get to the point 
where the bug shows up. Sometimes by forcing yourself to isolate the 
circumstances that display the bug, you'll even gain an insight on how to fix it.
See 
Ubiquitos Automation
, for other ideas along these lines.
Visualize Your Data
Often, the easiest way to discern what a program is doing—or what it is going to do—is t
o
get a good look at the data it is operating on. The simplest example of this is 
a
straightforward
 
""variable name = data value""
 approach, which may be implemented as 
printed text, or as fields in a GUI dialog box or list.
But you can gain a much deeper insight into your data by using a debugger that allows you 
to 
visualize
 your data and all of the interrelationships that exist. There are debuggers that 
can represent your data as a 3D fly-over through a virtual reality landscape, or as a 3D 
waveform plot, or just as simple structural diagrams, as shown in 
Figure 3.2
 on the next 
 page. As you single-step through your program, pictures like these can be worth much 
more than a thousand words, as the bug you've been hunting suddenly jumps out at you.
Figure 3.2. Sample debugger diagram of a circular linked list. The arrows represent pointers to 
nodes.
Even if your debugger has limited support for visualizing data, you can still do i
t
yourself—either by hand, with paper and pencil, or with external plotting programs
.
The DDD debugger has some visualization capabilities, and is freely available (see [
URL 
19
]). It is interesting to note that DDD works with multiple languages, including Ada, C, 
C++, Fortran, Java, Modula, Pascal, Perl, and Python (clearly an orthogonal design).
Tracing
Debuggers generally focus on the state of the program 
now.
 Sometimes you nee
d
more—you need to watch the state of a program or a data structure over time. Seeing 
a
stack trace can only tell you how you got here directly. It can't tell you what you were doin
g
prior to this call chain, especially in event-based systems
.
Tracing statements
 are those little diagnostic messages you print to the screen or to a file 
that say things such as ""got here"" and ""value of x = 2."" It's a primitive technique compared 
with IDE-style debuggers, but it is peculiarly effective at diagnosing several classes of 
errors that debuggers can't. Tracing is invaluable in any system where time itself is a 
factor: concurrent processes, real-time systems, and event-based applications.
You can use tracing statements to ""drill down"" into the code. That is, you can add tracing 
statements as you descend the call tree.
Trace messages should be in a regular, consistent format; you may want to parse them 
 automatically. For instance, if you needed to track down a resource leak (such as 
unbalanced file opens/closes), you could trace each 
open
 and each 
close
 in a log file. By 
processing the log file with Perl, you could easily identify where the offending 
open
 was 
occurring.
Corrupt Variables? Check Their Neighborhood
Sometimes you'll examine a variable, expecting to see a small integer value, and 
instead get something like 
0x6e69614d.
 Before you roll up your sleeves for some 
serious debugging, have a quick look at the memory around this corrupted 
variable. Often it will give you a clue. In our case, examining the surrounding 
memory as characters shows us
                                                       
 
    20333231 6e69614d 2c745320 746f4e0a
     1 2 3    M a i n    S t , \n N o t
    2c6e776f 2058580a 31323433 00000a33
     o w n , \n x x    3 4 2 1  3\n\0\0
Looks like someone sprayed a street address over our counter. Now we know 
where to look.
Rubber Ducking
A very simple but particularly useful technique for finding the cause of a problem is simply 
to explain it to someone else. The other person should look over your shoulder at the 
screen, and nod his or her head constantly (like a rubber duck bobbing up and down in a 
bathtub). They do not need to say a word; the simple act of explaining, step by step, what 
the code is supposed to do often causes the problem to leap off the screen and announce 
itself.
[7]
[7]
 Why ""rubber ducking""? While an undergraduate at Imperial College in London, Dave did a lot of wor
k
with a research assistant named Greg Pugh, one of the best developers Dave has known. For several 
months Greg carried around a small yellow rubber duck, which he'd place on his terminal while coding. It 
was a while before Dave had the courage to ask....
It sounds simple, but in explaining the problem to another person you must explicitly state 
things that you may take for granted when going through the code yourself. By having to 
 verbalize some of these assumptions, you may suddenly gain new insight into the problem.
Process of Elimination
In most projects, the code you are debugging may be a mixture of application code written 
by you and others on your project team, third-party products (database, connectivity, 
graphical libraries, specialized communications or algorithms, and so on) and the platform 
environment (operating system, system libraries, and compilers).
It is possible that a bug exists in the OS, the compiler, or a third-party product—but thi
s
should not be your first thought. It is much more likely that the bug exists in the applicatio
n
code under development. It is generally more profitable to assume that the applicatio
n
code is incorrectly calling into a library than to assume that the library itself is broken. Eve
n
if the problem
 
does
 lie with a third party, you'll still have to","[-0.0037105742, 0.025221797, 0.059369188, 0.008218076, 0.008358025, -0.009477612, 0.014523526, -0.0011681798, -0.01830213, 0.05750321, 0.09491606,

if the problem
 
does
 lie with a third party, you'll still have to eliminate your code before 
submitting the bug report.
We worked on a project where a senior engineer was convinced that the 
select
 system call 
was broken on Solaris. No amount of persuasion or logic could change his mind (the fact 
that every other networking application on the box worked fine was irrelevant). He spent 
weeks writing work-arounds, which, for some odd reason, didn't seem to fix the problem. 
When finally forced to sit down and read the documentation on 
select,
 he discovered the 
problem and corrected it in a matter of minutes. We now use the phrase ""select is broken"" 
as a gentle reminder whenever one of us starts blaming the system for a fault that is likely 
to be our own.
Tip 26
""select"" Isn't Broken
Remember, if you see hoof prints, think horses—not zebras. The OS is probably no
t
broken. And the database is probably just fine
.
If you ""changed only one thing"" and the system stopped working, that one thing was likely 
to be responsible, directly or indirectly, no matter how farfetched it seems. Sometimes the 
thing that changed is outside of your control: new versions of the OS, compiler, database, 
or other third-party software can wreak havoc with previously correct code. New bugs 
 might show up. Bugs for which you had a work-around get fixed, breaking the work-around. 
APIs change, functionality changes; in short, it's a whole new ball game, and you must 
retest the system under these new conditions. So keep a close eye on the schedule when 
considering an upgrade; you may want to wait until 
after
 the next release.
If, however, you have no obvious place to start looking, you can always rely on a good 
old-fashioned binary search. See if the symptoms are present at either of two far away 
spots in the code. Then look in the middle. If the problem is present, then the bug lies 
between the start and the middle point; otherwise, it is between the middle point and the 
end. You can continue in this fashion until you narrow down the spot sufficiently to identify 
the problem.
The Element of Surprise
When you find yourself surprised by a bug (perhaps even muttering ""that's impossible
""
under your breath where we can't hear you), you must reevaluate truths you hold dear. I
n
that linked list routine—the one you knew was bulletproof and couldn't possibly be th
e
cause of this bug—did you test
 
all
 the boundary conditions? That other piece of cod
e
you've been using for years—it couldn't possibly still have a bug in it. Could it
?
Of course it can. The amount of surprise you feel when something goes wrong is directly 
proportional to the amount of trust and faith you have in the code being run. That's why, 
when faced with a ""surprising"" failure, you must realize that one or more of your 
assumptions is wrong. Don't gloss over a routine or piece of code involved in the bug 
because you ""know"" it works. Prove it. Prove it in 
this
 context, with this data, with 
these
boundary conditions.
Tip 27
Don't Assume It—Prove I
t
When you come across a surprise bug, beyond merely fixing it, you need to determine why 
this failure wasn't caught earlier. Consider whether you need to amend the unit or other 
tests so that they would have caught it.
 Also, if the bug is the result of bad data that was propagated through a couple of levels 
before causing the explosion, see if better parameter checking in those routines would 
have isolated it earlier (see the discussions on crashing early and assertions on pages 120 
and 122, respectively).
While you're at it, are there any other places in the code that may be susceptible to this 
same bug? Now is the time to find and fix them. Make sure that 
whatever
 happened, you'll 
know if it happens again.
If it took a long time to fix this bug, ask yourself why. Is there anything you can do to make 
fixing this bug easier the next time around? Perhaps you could build in better testing hooks, 
or write a log file analyzer.
Finally, if the bug is the result of someone's wrong assumption, discuss the problem with 
the whole team: if one person misunderstands, then it's possible many people do.
Do all this, and hopefully you won't be surprised next time.
Debugging Checklist
Is the problem being reported a direct result of the underlying bug, or merely a 
symptom?
Is the bug 
really
 in the compiler? Is it in the OS? Or is it in your code?
If you explained this problem in detail to a coworker, what would you say?
If the suspect code passes its unit tests, are the tests complete enough? What 
happens if you run the unit test with 
this
 data?
Do the conditions that caused this bug exist anywhere else in the system?

Text Manipulation
Pragmatic Programmers manipulate text the same way woodworkers shape wood. I
n
previous sections we discussed some specific tools—shells, editors, debuggers—that w
e
use. These are similar to a wood-worker's chisels, saws, and planes—tools specialized t
o
do one or two jobs well. However, every now and then we need to perform som
e
transformation not readily handled by the basic tool set. We need a general-purpose tex
t
manipulation tool
.
Text manipulation languages are to programming what routers
[8]
 are to woodworking. The
y
are noisy, messy, and somewhat brute force. Make mistakes with them, and entire pieces 
can be ruined. Some people swear they have no place in the toolbox. But in the right 
hands, both routers and text manipulation languages can be incredibly powerful and 
versatile. You can quickly trim something into shape, make joints, and carve. Used 
properly, these tools have surprising finesse and subtlety. But they take time to master.
[8]
 Here
 
router
 means the tool that spins cutting blades very, very fast, not a device for interconnecting 
networks.
There is a growing number of good text manipulation languages. Unix developers often like 
to use the power of their command shells, augmented with tools such as 
awk
 and 
sed.
People who prefer a more structured tool like the object-oriented nature of Python [
URL 9
]. 
Some people use Tcl [
URL 23
] as their tool of choice. We happen to prefer Perl [
URL 8
] for 
hacking out short scripts.
These languages are important enabling technologies. Using them, you can quickly hac
k
up utilities and prototype ideas—jobs that might take five or ten times as long usin

" ideas—jobs that might take five or ten times as long usin
g
conventional languages. And that multiplying factor is crucially important to the kind o
f
experimenting that we do. Spending 30 minutes trying out a crazy idea is a whole lot bette
r
that spending five hours. Spending a day automating important components of a project i
s
acceptable; spending a week might not be. In their book
 
The Practice of Programming
[
KP99
], Kernighan and Pike built the same program in five different languages. The Perl 
version was the shortest (17 lines, compared with C's 150). With Perl you can manipulate 
text, interact with programs, talk over networks, drive Web pages, perform arbitrary 
precision arithmetic, and write programs that look like Snoopy swearing.
Tip 28
 Learn a Text Manipulation Language
To show the wide-ranging applicability of text manipulation languages, here's a sample of 
some applications we've developed over the last few years.
Database schema maintenance. 
 
 A set of Perl scripts took a plain text fil
e
containing a database schema definition and from it generated:
The SQL statements to create the database
Flat data files to populate a data dictionary
C code libraries to access the database
Scripts to check database integrity
Web pages containing schema descriptions and diagrams
An XML version of the schema
Java property access. 
 
 It is good OO programming style to restrict access to a
n
object's properties, forcing external classes to get and set them via methods. 
However, in the common case where a property is represented inside the class by 
a simple member variable, creating a get and set method for each variable is 
tedious and mechanical. We have a Perl script that modifies the source files and 
inserts the correct method definitions for all appropriately flagged variables.
Test data generation. 
 
 We had tens of thousands of records of test data, sprea
d
over several different files and formats, that needed to be knitted together and 
converted into a form suitable for loading into a relational database. Perl did it in a 
couple of hours (and in the process found a couple of consistency errors in the 
original data).
Book writing. 
 
 We think it is important that any code presented in a book shoul
d
have been tested first. Most of the code in this book has been. However, using the 
DRY
 principle (see 
The Evils of Duplication
) we didn't want to copy and paste line
s
of code from the tested programs into the book. That would have meant that th
e
 code was duplicated, virtually guaranteeing that we'd forget to update an exampl
e
when the corresponding program was changed. For some examples, we also didn'
t
want to bore you with all the framework code needed to make our example compil
e
and run. We turned to Perl. A relatively simple script is invoked when we format th
e
book—it extracts a named segment of a source file, does syntax highlighting, an
d
converts the result into the typesetting language we use
.
C to Object Pascal interface. 
 
 A client had a team of developers writing Objec
t
Pascal on PCs. Their code needed to interface to a body of code written in C. We 
developed a short Perl script that parsed the C header files, extracting the 
definitions of all exported functions and the data structures they used. We then 
generated Object Pascal units with Pascal records for all the C structures, and 
imported procedure definitions for all the C functions. This generation process 
became part of the build, so that whenever the C header changed, a new Object 
Pascal unit would be constructed automatically.
Generating Web documentation. 
 
 Many project teams are publishing thei
r
documentation to internal Web sites. We have written many Perl programs that 
analyze database schemas, C or C++ source files, makefiles, and other project 
sources to produce the required HTML documentation. We also use Perl to wrap 
the documents with standard headers and footers, and to transfer them to the Web 
site.
We use text manipulation languages almost every day. Many of the ideas in this book can 
be implemented more simply in them than in any other language of which we're aware. 
These languages make it easy to write code generators, which we'll look at next.

Exercises
11.
Your C program uses an enumerated type to represent one of 100 states. 
You'd like to be able to print out the state as a string (as opposed to a 
number) for debugging purposes. Write a script that reads from standard input 
a file containing
                                                       
 
    name
    state_a
    state_b
     :    :
Produce the file 
name.h,
 which contains
                                                       
 
    
extern const char
* NAME_names[];
    
typedef enum
 {
       state_a,
       state_b,
        :    :
     } NAME;
and the file 
name.c,
 which contains
                                                       
 
    
const char
* NAME_names[] = {
       
""state_a"",
       
""state_b"",
         :    :
     };
12.
Halfway through writing this book, we realized that we hadn't put the 
use strict
directive into many of our Perl examples. Write a script that goes through the 
 .p1
 flies in a directory and adds a 
use strict
 at the end of the initial comment 
block to all flies that don't already have one. Remember to keep a backup of 
all flies you change
 .

Code Generators
When woodworkers are faced with the task of producing the same thing over and over, 
they cheat. They build themselves a jig or a template. If they get the jig right once, they can 
reproduce a piece of work time after time. The jig takes away complexity and reduces the 
chances of making mistakes, leaving the craftsman free to concentrate on quality.
As programmers, we often find ourselves in a similar position. We need to achieve the 
same functionality, but in different contexts. We need to repeat information in different 
places. Sometimes we just need to protect ourselves from carpal tunnel syndrome by 
cutting down on repetitive typing.
In the same way a woodworker invests the time in a jig, a programmer can build a code 
generator. Once built, it can be used throughout the life of the project at virtually no cost.
Tip 29
Write Code That Writes Code
There are two main types of code generators:
Passive code generators
 are run once to produce a result. From that poin
t
forward, the result becomes freestanding—it is divorced from the code generator
.
The wizards discussed in
 
Evil Wizards,
 along with some CASE tools, are examples 
of passive code generators.

.
Active code generators
 are used each time their results are required. The result i
s
a throw-away—it can always be reproduced by the code generator. Often, activ
e
code generators read some form of script or control file to produce their results
.

Passive Code Generators
Passive code generators save typing. They are basically parameterized templates, 
 generating a given output from a set of inputs. Once the result is produced, it becomes a 
full-fledged source file in the project; it will be edited, compiled, and placed under source 
control just like any other file. Its origins will be forgotten.
Passive code generators have many uses:
Creating new source files.
 A passive code generator can produce templates, 
source code control directives, copyright notices, and standard comment blocks for 
each new file in a project. We have our editors set up to do this whenever we 
create a new file: edit a new Java program, and the new editor buffer will 
automatically contain a comment block, package directive, and the outline class 
declaration, already filled in.
Performing one-off conversions
 among programming languages. We started 
writing this book using the troff system, but we switched to LaTeXafter 15 sections 
had been completed. We wrote a code generator that read the troff source and 
converted it to LaTeX. It was about 90% accurate; the rest we did by hand. This is 
an interesting feature of passive code generators: they don't have to be totally 
accurate. You get to choose how much effort you put into the generator, compared 
with the energy you spend fixing up its output.
Producing lookup tables and other resources
 that are expensive to compute at 
runtime. Instead of calculating trigonometric functions, many early graphics 
systems used precomputed tables of sine and cosine values. Typically, these 
tables were produced by a passive code generator and then copied into the source.
Active Code Generators
While passive code generators are simply a convenience, their active cousins are a 
necessity if you want to follow the 
DRY
 principle. With an active code generator, you can 
take a single representation of some piece of knowledge and convert it into all the forms 
your application needs. This 
is not
 duplication, because the derived forms are disposable, 
and are generated as needed by the code generator (hence the word 
active
)
.
Whenever you find yourself trying to get two disparate environments to work together, you 
should consider using active code generators.
Perhaps you're developing a database application. Here, you're dealing with tw
o
environments—the database and the programming language you are using to access it
.
 You have a schema, and you need to define low-level structures mirroring the layout o
f
certain database tables. You could just code these directly, but this violates the
 
DRY
principle: knowledge of the schema would then be expressed in two places. When the 
schema changes, you need to remember to change the corresponding code. If a column is 
removed from a table, but the code base is not changed, you might not even get a 
compilation error. The first you'll know about it is when your tests start failing (or when the 
user calls).
An alternative is to use an active code generator—take the schema and use it to generat
e
the source code for the structures, as shown in
 
Figure 3.3
. Now, whenever the schema 
changes, the code used to access it also changes, automatically. If a column is removed, 
then its corresponding field in the structure will disappear, and any higher-level code that 
uses that column will fail to compile. You've caught the error at compile time, not in 
production. Of course, this scheme works only if you make the code generation part of the 
build process itself.
[9]
[9]
 Just
 
how
 do you go about building code from a database schema? There are several ways. If the 
schema is held in a flat file (for example, as 
create table
 statements), then a relatively simple script can 
parse it and generate the source. Alternatively, if you use a tool to create the schema directly in the 
database, then you should be able to extract the information you need directly from the database's data 
dictionary. Perl provides libraries that give you access to most major databases.
Figure 3.3. Active code generator creates code from a database schema
Another example of melding environments using code generators happens when differen
t
programming languages are used in the same application. In order to communicate, eac
h
code base will need some information in common—data structures, message formats, an
d
field names, for example. Rather than duplicate this information, use a code generator
.
Sometimes you can parse the information out of the source files of one language and use i
t
to generate code in a second language. Often, though, it is simpler to express it in 
a
simpler, language-neutral representation and generate the code for both languages, a
s
shown in
 
Figure 3.4
 on the following page. Also see the answer to Exercise 13 on page 
286 for an example of how to separate the parsing of the flat file representation from code 
 generation.
Figure 3.4. Generating code from a language-neutral representation. In the input file, lines 
starting with 'M' flag the start of a message definition, 'F' lines define fields, and 'E' is the end 
of the message.
Code Generators Needn't Be Complex
All this talk of 
active
 this and 
passive
 that may leave you with the impression that code 
generators are complex beasts. They needn't be. Normally the most complex part is the 
parser, which analyzes the input file. Keep the input format simple, and the code generator 
becomes simple. Have a look at the answer to Exercise 13 (page 286): the actual code 
generation is basically 
print
 statements.
Code Generators Needn't Generate Code
Although many of the examples in this section show code generators that produc
e
program source, this needn't always be the case. You can use code generators to writ
e
just about any output: HTML, XML, plain text—any text that might be an input somewher
e
else in your project

Tip 30
You Can't Write Perfect Software
Did that hurt? It shouldn't. Accept it as an axiom of life. Embrace it. Celebrate it. Because 
perfect software doesn't exist. No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a 
piece of perfect software. It's unlikely that you'll be the first. And unless you accept this as a 
fact, you'll end up wasting time and energy chasing an impossible dream.
So, given this depressing reality, how does a Pragmatic Programmer turn it into an 
advantage?

", how does a Pragmatic Programmer turn it into an 
advantage? That's the topic of this chapter.
Everyone knows that they personally are the only good driver on Earth. The rest of the 
world is out there to get them, blowing through stop signs, weaving between lanes, not 
indicating turns, talking on the telephone, reading the paper, and just generally not living up 
to our standards. So we drive defensively. We look out for trouble before it happens, 
anticipate the unexpected, and never put ourselves into a position from which we can't 
extricate ourselves.
The analogy with coding is pretty obvious. We are constantly interfacing with other people'
s
code—code that might not live up to our high standards—and dealing with inputs that ma
y
or may not be valid. So we are taught to code defensively. If there's any doubt, we validat
e
all information we're given. We use assertions to detect bad data. We check fo
r
consistency, put constraints on database columns, and generally feel pretty good abou
t
ourselves
.
But Pragmatic Programmers take this a step further. 
They don't trust themselves, either.
Knowing that no one writes perfect code, including themselves, Pragmatic Programmers 
code in defenses against their own mistakes. We describe the first defensive measure in 
Design by Contract:
 clients and suppliers must agree on rights and responsibilities.
 In 
Dead Programs Tell No Lies,
 we want to ensure that we do no damage while we're 
working the bugs out. So we try to check things often and terminate the program if things 
go awry.
Assertive Programming
 describes an easy method of checking along the way—write cod
e
that actively verifies your assumptions
.
Exceptions, like any other technique, can cause more harm than good if not used properly. 
We'll discuss the issues in 
When to Use Exceptions.
As your programs get more dynamic, you'll find yourself juggling syste
m
resources—memory, files, devices, and the like. In
 
How to Balance Resources,
 we'll 
suggest ways of ensuring that you don't drop any of the balls.
In a world of imperfect systems, ridiculous time scales, laughable tools, and impossible 
requirements, let's play it safe.
When everybody actually is out to get you, paranoia is just good thinking.

Design by Contract
Nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing.
Ralph Waldo Emerson, 
Essays
Dealing with computer systems is hard. Dealing with people is even harder. But as a 
species, we've had longer to figure out issues of human interactions. Some of the solutions 
we've come up with during the last few millennia can be applied to writing software as well. 
One of the best solutions for ensuring plain dealing is the 
contract.
A contract defines your rights and responsibilities, as well as those of the other party. In 
addition, there is an agreement concerning repercussions if either party fails to abide by 
the contract.
Maybe you have an employment contract that specifies the hours you'll work and the rules 
of conduct you must follow. In return, the company pays you a salary and other perks. 
Each party meets its obligations and everyone benefits.
It's an idea used the world over—both formally and informally—to help humans interact
.
Can we use the same concept to help software modules interact? The answer is ""yes.
""
DBC
Bertrand Meyer [
Mey97b
] developed the concept of 
Design by Contract
 for the language 
Eiffel.
[1]
 It is a simple yet powerful technique that focuses on documenting (and agreeing to
)
the rights and responsibilities of software modules to ensure program correctness. What is 
a correct program? One that does no more and no less than it claims to do. Documenting 
and verifying that claim is the heart of 
Design by Contract
 (DBC, for short).
[1]
 Based in part on earlier work by Dijkstra, Floyd, Hoare, Wirth, and others. For more information o
n
Eiffel itself, see [
URL 10
] and [
URL 11
].
Every function and method in a software system 
does something.
 Before it starts that 
something,
 the routine may have some expectation of the state of the world, and it may be 
able to make a statement about the state of the world when it concludes. Meyer describes 
these expectations and claims as follows:
 Preconditions. 
 
 What must be true in order for the routine to be called; th
e
routine's requirements. A routine should never get called when its preconditions 
would be violated. It is the caller's responsibility to pass good data (see the box on 
page 115).
Postconditions. 
 
 What the routine is guaranteed to do; the state of the worl
d
when the routine is done. The fact that the routine has a postcondition implies that 
it 
will
 conclude: infinite loops aren't allowed.
Class invariants. 
 
 A class ensures that this condition is always true from th
e
perspective of a caller. During internal processing of a routine, the invariant may not 
hold, but by the time the routine exits and control returns to the caller, the invariant 
must be true. (Note that a class cannot give unrestricted write-access to any data 
member that participates in the invariant.)
Let's look at the contract for a routine that inserts a data value into a unique, ordered list. In 
iContract, a preprocessor for Java available from [
URL 17
], you'd specify it as
                                       
 
    /**
      * 
@invariant forall Node n in elements() |
      *    
n.prev() != null
      *      
implies
      *         
n.value().compare To(n.prev().value()) > 0
      */
    
public class
 dbc_list {
      /**
        * 
@pre contains(aNode) == false
        * 
@post contains(aNode) == true
        */
      
public void
 insertNode(
final
 Node aNode) {
        // ...
Here we are saying that nodes in this list must always be in increasing order. When you 
insert a new node, it can't exist already, and we guarantee that the node will be found after 
you have inserted it.
You write these preconditions, postconditions, and invariants in the target programmin
g
language, perhaps with some extensions. For example, iContract provides predicate logi
c
operators
—
forall, exists,
 and 
implies
—in addition to normal Java constructs. You
r
 assertions can query the state of any object that the method can access, but be sure tha
t
the query is free from any side effects (see page 124)
.
DBC and Constant Parameters
Often, a postcondition will use parameters passed into a method to verify correct 
behavior. But if the routine is allowed to change the parameter that's passed in, 
you might be able to circumvent the contract. Eiffel doesn't allow this to happen, 
but Java does. Here, we use the Java keyword 
final
 to indicate our intention

"but Java does. Here, we use the Java keyword 
final
 to indicate our intention
s
that the parameter shouldn't be changed within the method. This isn'
t
foolproof–subclasses are free to redeclare the parameter as non-final
.
Alternatively, you can use the iContract syntax
 
variable
@pre
 to get the original 
value of the variable as it existed on entry to the method.
The contract between a routine and any potential caller can thus be read as
If all the routine's preconditions are met by the caller, the routine shall 
guarantee that all postconditions and invariants will be true when it 
completes.
If either party fails to live up to the terms of the contract, then a remedy (which wa
s
previously agreed to) is invoked—an exception is raised, or the program terminates, fo
r
instance. Whatever happens, make no mistake that failure to live up to the contract is 
a
bug. It is not something that should ever happen, which is why preconditions should not b
e
used to perform things such as user-input validation
.
Tip 31
Design with Contracts
In 
Orthogonality
, we recommended writing ""shy"" code. Here, the emphasis is on ""lazy"" 
code: be strict in what you will accept before you begin, and promise as little as possible in 
return. Remember, if your contract indicates that you'll accept anything and promise the 
world in return, then you've got a lot of code to write!
 Inheritance and polymorphism are the cornerstones of object-oriented languages and an 
area where contracts can really shine. Suppose you are using inheritance to create an 
""is-a-kind-of"" relationship, where one class ""is-a-kind-of"" another class. You probably want 
to adhere to the 
Liskov Substitution Principle
 [
Lis88
]:
Subclasses must be usable through the base class interface without the 
need for the user to know the difference.
In other words, you want to make sure that the new subtype you have created reall
y
""is-a-klnd-of"" the base type—that it supports the same methods, and that the method
s
have the same meaning. We can do this with contracts. We need to specify a contract onl
y
once, in the base class, to have it applied to every future subclass automatically. 
A
subclass may, optionally, accept a wider range of input, or make stronger guarantees. Bu
t
it must accept at least as much, and guarantee as much, as its parent
.
For example, consider the Java base class 
java.awt.Component.
 You can treat any visual 
component in AWT or Swing as a 
Component,
 without knowing that the actual subclass is 
a button, a canvas, a menu, or whatever. Each individual component can provide 
additional, specific functionality, but it has to provide at least the basic capabilities defined 
by 
Component.
 But there's nothing to prevent you from creating a subtype of 
Component
that provides correctly named methods that do the wrong thing. You can easily create a 
paint
 method that doesn't paint, or a 
setFont
 method that doesn't set the font. AWT doesn't 
have contracts to catch the fact that you didn't live up to the agreement.
Without a contract, all the compiler can do is ensure that a subclass conforms to a 
particular method signature. But if we put a base class contract in place, we can now 
ensure that any future subclass can't alter the 
meanings
 of our methods. For instance, you 
might want to establish a contract for 
setFont
 such as the following, which ensures that the 
font you set is the font you get:
                                       
 
    /**
      * 
@pre  f != null
      * 
@post getFont()
 == 
f
      */
      
public void
 setFont(
final
 Font f) {
       // ...
Implementing DBC
 The greatest benefit of using DBC may be that it forces the issue of requirements an
d
guarantees to the forefront. Simply enumerating at design time what the input domai
n
range is, what the boundary conditions are, and what the routine promises to deliver—or
,
more importantly, what it
 
doesn't
 promise to deliver—is a huge leap forward in writin
g
better software. By not stating these things, you are back to
 
programming by coincidence
, 
which is where many projects start, finish, and fail.
In languages that do not support DBC in the code, this might be as far as you can go—an
d
that's not too bad. DBC is, after all, a
 
design
 technique. Even without automatic checking, 
you can put the contract in the code as comments and still get a very real benefit. If nothing 
else, the commented contracts give you a place to start looking when trouble strikes.
Assertions
While documenting these assumptions is a great start, you can get much greater benefit by 
having the compiler check your contract for you. You can partially emulate this in some 
languages by using 
assertions
 (see 
Assertive Programming
). Why only partially? Can't 
you use assertions to do everything DBC can do?
Unfortunately, the answer is no. To begin with, there is no support for propagating 
assertions down an inheritance hierarchy. This means that if you override a base class 
method that has a contract, the assertions that implement that contract will not be called 
correctly (unless you duplicate them manually in the new code). You must remember to call 
the class invariant (and all base class invariants) manually before you exit every method. 
The basic problem is that the contract is not automatically enforced.
Also, there is no built-in concept of ""old"" values; that is, values as they existed at the entry 
to a method. If you're using assertions to enforce contracts, you must add code to the 
precondition to save any information you'll want to use in the postcondition. Compare this 
with iContract, where the postcondition can just reference 
""
Variable
@pre,""
 or with Eiffel, 
which supports 
""old
 
expression
.""
Finally, the runtime system and libraries are not designed to support contracts, so these 
calls are not checked. This is a big loss, because it is often at the boundary between your 
code and the libraries it uses that the most problems are detected (see 
Dead Programs 
Tell No Lies
 for a more detailed discussion).
Language Support
 Languages that feature built-in support of DBC (such as Eiffel and Sather [
URL 12
]) check 
pre- and postconditions automatically in the compiler and runtime system. You get the 
greatest benefit in this case because 
all
 of the code base (libraries, too) must honor their 
contracts.
But what about more popular languages such as C, C++, and Java? For these languages, 
there are preprocessors that process contracts embedded in the original source code as 
special comments. The preprocessor expands these comments to code that verifies the 
assertions.
For C and C++, you may want to investigate

.
DBC and Crashing Early
DBC fits in nicely with our concept of crashing early (see 
Dead Programs Tell No Lies
). 
Suppose you have a method that calculates square roots (such as in the Eiffel class 
DOUBLE
). It needs a precondition that restricts the domain to positive numbers. An Eiffel 
precondition is declared with the keyword 
require,
 and a postcondition is declared with 
ensure,
 so you could write
                                       
 
        sqrt: DOUBLE 
is
              -- 
Square root routine
           
require
              sqrt_arg_must_be_positive: Current >= 0;
           --- ...
           --- 
calculate square root here
           --- ...
           
ensure
              ((Result*Result) - Current).abs <= epsilon*Current.abs;
               -- 
Result should
 be 
within error tolerance
           
end;
                                       
 
Who's responsible?
Who is repondible for cheeking the precondition, the caller or the routine being 
called? when implemented as part of the language, the answer is neither: the 
routine but before the routine itself is entered. Thus if there is any explicit 
checking of parameters to be done, it must be performed by the 
caller,
because 
the routine itself will never see parameters that violate its precondition. (For 
languages without built-in support, you would need to bracket the 
called
 routine 
with a preamble and/or postamble that checks these assertions.)
Consider a program that reads a number from the console, calculate its square 
root (by calling 
sqrt
), and prints the result. The 
sqrt
 function has 
a
precondition—its argument must not be negative. If the user enters a negativ
e
number at the console, it is up to the calling code to ensure that it never get
s
passed to
 
sqrt.
 This calling code has many options: it could terminate, it could 
issue a warning and read another number, or it could make the number postive 
and append an ""
i
"" to the result returned by 
sqrt.
 Whater its choice, this is 
definitely not 
sqrt
's problem.
By expressing the domain of the square root function in the precondition of the 
sqrt
 routine, you shift the burden of correctness to the call—where it belongs. yo
u
can then design the
 
sqrt
 routine secure in the knowledge its input 
will
 be in range.
If your algorithm for calculating the square root fails (or isn't within the specified error 
tolerance), you get an error message and a stack trace to show you the call chain.
If you pass 
sqrt
 a negative parameter, the Eiffel runtime prints the error 
""sqrt_arg_must_be_positive,""
 along with a stack trace. This is better than the alternative in 
languages such as Java, C, and C++, where passing a negative number to 
sqrt
 returns the 
special value 
NaN
 (Not a Number). It may be some time later in the program that you 
attempt to do some math on 
NaN,
 with surprising results.
It's much easier to find and diagnose the problem by crashing early, at the site of the 
 problem.
Other Uses of Invariants
So far we have discussed pre- and postconditions that apply to individual methods and 
invariants that apply to all methods within a class, but there are other useful ways to use 
invariants.
Loop Invariants
Getting the boundary conditions right on a nontrMal loop can be problematic. Loops are 
subject to the banana problem (I know how to spell ""banana,"" but I don't know when to 
stop), fencepost errors (not knowing whether to count the fenceposts or the spaces 
between them), and the ubiquitous ""off by one"" error [
URL 52
].
Invariants can help in these situations: a 
loop invariant
 is a statement of the eventual goal 
of a loop, but is generalized so that it is also valid before the loop executes and on each 
iteration through the loop. You can think of it as a kind of miniature contract. The classic 
example is a routine that finds the maximum value in an array.
                                               
 
    
int
 m = arr[0];   // 
example assumes arr.length > 0
    
int
 i = 1;
    // 
Loop invariant: m = max(arr[0:i-1])
    
while
 (i < arr.length) {
      m = Math.max(m, arr[i]);
      i = i + 1;
    }
(
arr[m:n]
 is a notational convenience meaning a slice of the array from index 
m
 to 
n.
) The 
invariant must be true before the loop runs, and the body of the loop must ensure that it 
remains true as the loop executes. In this way we know that the invariant also holds when 
the loop terminates, and therefore that our result is valid. Loop invariants can be coded 
explicitly as assertions, but they are also useful as design and documentation tools.
Semantic Invariants
You can use 
semantic invariants
 to express inviolate requirements, a kind of 
 ""philosophical contract.""
We once wrote a debit card transaction switch. A major requirement was that the user of a 
debit card should never have the same transaction applied to their account twice. In other 
words, no matter what sort of failure mode might happen, the error should be on the side of 
not
 processing a transaction rather than processing a duplicate transaction.
This simple law, driven directly from the requirements, proved to be very helpful in sorting 
out complex error recovery scenarios, and guided the detailed design and implementation 
in many areas.
Be sure not to confuse requirements that are fixed, inviolate laws with those that are 
merely policies that might change with a new management regime. That's why we use the 
term 
semantic
 invariants—it must be central to the very
 
meaning
 of a thing, and not 
subject to the whims of policy (which is what more dynamic business rules are for).
When you find a requirement that qualifies, make sure it becomes a well-known part o
f
whatever documentation you are producing— whether it is a bulleted list in th
e
requirements document that gets signed in triplicate or just a big note on the commo
n
whiteboard that everyone sees. Try to state it clearly and unambiguously. For example, i

" THE CONSUMER
.
This is a clear, concise, unambiguous statement that's applicable in many different areas of 
the system. It is our contract with all users of the system, our guarantee of behavior.
Dynamic Contracts and Agents
Until now, we have talked about contracts as fixed, immutable specifications. But in the 
landscape of autonomous agents, this doesn't need to be the case. By the definition of 
""autonomous,"" agents are free to 
reject
 requests that they do not want to honor. They ar
e
free to renegotiate the contract—""I can't provide that, but if you give me this, then I migh
t
provide something else.
""
Certainly any system that relies on agent technology has a 
critical
 dependence o
n
contractual arrangements—even if they are dynamically generated
.
Imagine: with enough components and agents that can negotiate their own contracts 
 among themselves to achieve a goal, we might just solve the software productivity crisis by 
letting software solve it for us.
But if we can't use contracts by hand, we won't be able to use them automatically. So next 
time you design a piece of software, design its contract as well.

Points to ponder: If DBC is so powerful, why isn't it used more widely? Is it hard to 
come up with the contract? Does it make you think about issues you'd rather ignore 
for now? Does it force you to THINK!? Clearly, this is a dangerous tool!
Exercises
14.
What makes a good contract? Anyone can add preconditions and 
postconditions, but will they do you any good? Worse yet, will they actually do 
more harm than good? For the example below and for those in Exercises 15 
and 16, decide whether the specified contract is good, bad, or ugly, and 
 explain why
.
First, let's look at an Eiffel example. Here we have a routine for adding a 
STRING
 to a doubly linked, circular list (remember that preconditions are 
labeled with 
require,
 and postconditions with 
ensure
).
                                                               
 
    -- 
Add an item to a doubly linked list,
    -- 
and return the newly created NODE.
    add_item (item : STRING) : NODE 
is
       
require
          item /= Void                  -- 
'/=' is 'not equal'.
       
deferred
 -- 
Abstract base class.
       
ensure
          result.next.previous = result -- 
Check the newly
          result.previous.next = result -- 
added node's links.
          find_item(item) = result      -- 
Should find it.
       
end
                                                               
 
15.
Next, let's try an example in Java?somewhat similar to the example i
n
Exercise 14.
 
insertNumber
 inserts an integer into an ordered list. Pre-and 
postconditions are labeled as in iContract (see [
URL 17
]) .
                                                               
 
    
private int
 data[];
    /**
      * 
@post data[index-1] < data[index] &&
      *       
data[index] == aValue
      */
    
public
 Node insertNumber (
final int
 aValue)
    {
      
int
 index = findPlaceToInsert(aValue);
      ...
 16.
Here's a fragment from a stack class in Java. Is this a good contract?
                                                               
 
    /**
      * 
@pre anItem != null   // Require real data
      * 
@post pop() == anItem // Verify that it's
      *                       
// on the stack
      */
    
public void
 push(
final
 String anItem)
17.
The classic examples of DBC (as in Exercises 14-16) show a
n
implementation of an ADT (Abstract Data Type)?typically a stack or queue
.
But not many people really write these kinds of low-level classe
s
.
So, for this exercise, design an interface to a kitchen blender. It will eventually 
be a Web-based, Internet-enabled, CORBA-fied blender, but for now we just 
need the interface to control it. It has ten speed settings (0 means off). You 
can't operate it empty, and you can change the speed only one unit at a time 
(that is, from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 2, not from 0 to 2).
Here are the methods. Add appropriate pre- and postconditions and an 
invariant.

Dead Programs Tell No Lies
Have you noticed that sometimes other people can detect that things aren't well with you 
before you're aware of the problem yourself? It's the same with other people's code. If 
something is starting to go awry with one of our programs, sometimes it is a library routine 
that catches it first. Maybe a stray pointer has caused us to overwrite a file handle with 
something meaningless. The next call to 
read
 will catch it. Perhaps a buffer overrun has 
trashed a counter we're about to use to determine how much memory to allocate. Maybe 
we'll get a failure from 
malloc.
 A logic error a couple of million instructions ago means that 
the selector for a case statement is no longer the expected 1, 2, or 3. We'll hit the 
default
case (which is one reason why each and every case/switch statement needs to have 
a
default clause—we want to know when the ""impossible"" has happened)
.
It's easy to fall into the ""it can't happen"" mentality. Most of us have written code that didn'
t
check that a file closed successfully, or that a trace statement got written as we expected
.
And all things being equal, it's likely that we didn't need to—the code in question wouldn'
t
fail under any normal conditions. But we're coding defensively. We're looking for rogu
e
pointers in other parts of our program trashing the stack. We're checking that the correc
t
versions of shared libraries were actually loaded
.
All errors give you information. You could convince yourself that the error can't happen, 
and choose to ignore it. Instead, Pragmatic Programmers tell themselves that if there is an 
error, something very, very bad has happened.
Tip 32
Crash Early
Crash, Don't Trash
One of the benefits of detecting problems as soon as you can is that you can crash earlier. 
And many times, crashing your program is the best thing you can do. The alternative may 
be to continue, writing corrupted data to some vital database or commanding the washing 
 machine into its twentieth consecutive spin cycle.
The Java language and libraries have embraced this philosophy. When something

" into its twentieth consecutive spin cycle.
The Java language and libraries have embraced this philosophy. When something 
unexpected happens within the runtime system, it throws a 
RuntimeException.
 If not 
caught, this will percolate up to the top level of the program and cause it to halt, displaying 
a stack trace.
You can do the same in other languages. If you don't have an exception mechanism, or if 
your libraries don't throw exceptions, then make sure you handle the errors yourself. In C, 
macros can be very useful for this:
                                       
 
    
#define
 CHECK(LINE, EXPECTED)               \
      { 
int
 rc = LINE;                          \
        
if
 (rc != EXPECTED)                     \
            ut_abort(__FILE__, __LINE__, #LINE,  rc, EXPECTED); }
    
void
 ut_abort(
char
 *file, 
int
 ln, 
char
 *line, 
int
 rc, 
int
 exp) {
      fprintf(stderr, 
""%s line %d\n'%s': expected %d, got %d\n"",
                      file, ln, line, exp, rc);
      exit(1);
    }
Then you can wrap calls that should never fail using
                                       
 
    CHECK(stat(""/tmp"", &stat_buff), 0);
If it should fail, you'd get a message written to 
stderr:
                                       
 
    source.c line 19
    'stat(""/tmp"", &stat_buff)': expected 0, got -1
Clearly it is sometimes inappropriate simply to exit a running program. You may have 
claimed resources that might not get released, or you may need to write log messages, tidy 
up open transactions, or interact with other processes. The techniques we discuss in 
When 
to Use Exceptions
, will help here. However, the basic principle stays the same—when you
r
code discovers that something that was supposed to be impossible just happened, you
r
program is no longer viable. Anything it does from this point forward becomes suspect, s
o
terminate it as soon as possible. A dead program normally does a lot less damage than 
a
 crippled one

Assertive Programming
There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel no one else has 
a right to blame us.
Oscar Wilde, The 
Picture of Dorian Gray
It seems that there's a mantra that every programmer must memorize early in his or her 
career. It is a fundamental tenet of computing, a core belief that we learn to apply to 
requirements, designs, code, comments, just about everything we do. It goes
T
HIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN
…
""This code won't be used 30 years from now, so two-digit dates are fine."" ""This applicatio
n
will never be used abroad, so why internationalize it?"" 
""
count
 can't be negative."" ""This
 
printf
can't fail.""
Let's not practice this kind of self-deception, particularly when coding.
Tip 33
If It Can't Happen, Use Assertions to Ensure That It Won't
Whenever you find yourself thinking ""but of course that could never happen,"" add code to 
check it. The easiest way to do this is with assertions. In most C and C++ implementations, 
you'll find some form of 
assert
 or 
_assert
 macro that checks a Boolean condition. These 
macros can be invaluable. If a pointer passed in to your procedure should never be 
NULL,
then check for it:
                               
 
    
void
 writeString(
char
 *string) {
        assert(string != NULL);
        ...
 Assertions are also useful checks on an algorithm's operation. Maybe you've written a 
clever sort algorithm. Check that it works:
                               
 
    
for
 (
int
 i = 0; i < num_entries-1; i++) {
        assert(sorted[i] <= sorted[i+i]);
    }
Of course, the condition passed to an assertion should not have a side effect (see the bo
x
on page 124). Also remember that assertions may be turned off at compile time—never pu
t
code that
 
must
 be executed into an 
assert.
Don't use assertions in place of real error handling. Assertions check for things that should 
never happen: you don't want to be writing code such as
                               
 
    printf(""
Enter 'Y' or 'N':
 "");
    ch = getchar();
    assert((ch == 'Y') || (ch == 'N'));    /* 
bad idea!
 */
And just because the supplied 
assert
 macros call 
exit
 when an assertion fails, there's no 
reason why versions you write should. If you need to free resources, have an assertion 
failure generate an exception, 
longjmp
 to an exit point, or call an error handler. Just make 
sure the code you execute in those dying milliseconds doesn't rely on the information that 
triggered the assertion failure in the first place.
Leave Assertions Turned On
There is a common misunderstanding about assertions, promulgated by the people who 
write compilers and language environments. It goes something like this:
Assertions odd some overhead to code. Because they check for things 
that should never happen, they'll get triggered only by a bug in the 
code. Once the code has been tested and shipped, they are no longer 
needed, and should be turned off to make the code run faster. 
Assertions are a debugging facility.
There are two patently wrong assumptions here. First, they assume that testing finds all 
the bugs. In reality, for any complex program you are unlikely to test even a miniscule 
 percentage of the permutations your code will be put through (see 
Ruthless Testing
). 
Second, the optimists are forgetting that your program runs in a dangerous world. During 
testing, rats probably won't gnaw through a communications cable, someone playing a 
game won't exhaust memory, and log files won't fill the hard drive. These things might 
happen when your program runs in a production environment. Your first line of defense is 
checking for any possible error, and your second is using assertions to try to detect those 
you've missed.
Turning off assertions when you deliver a program to production is like crossing a high wire 
without a net because you once made it across in practice. There's dramatic value, but it's 
hard to get life insurance.
Even if you 
do
 have performance issues, turn off only those assertions that really hit you. 
The sort example above may be a critical part of
Assertion and Side Effects
It is embarrassing when the code we add to detect errors actually ends up 
creatings new errors. This can happen with assertions if evaluating the condition 
has side effects. for example, in Java it would be a bad to code something such 
as
                                               
 
    
while
 (iter.hasmoreElements () {
      Test.ASSERT(iter.nextElements() != 
null
);
      object obj = iter.nextElement();
      // ....
    }
The 
.nextElement()
 call in the 
ASSERT
 has the side effects of moving the iterator 
past the element being fetched, and so the loop will process","[0.012679266, 0.030028692, 0.006994328, 0.022317834, 0.012671991, 0.0058231507, -0.0041318545, -0.025853189, 0.023001628, 0.04725445,

When to Use Exceptions
In 
Dead Programs Tell No Lies
, we suggested that it is good practice to check for ever
y
possible error—particularly the unexpected ones. However, in practice this can lead t
o
some pretty ugly code; the normal logic of your program can end up being totally obscure
d
by error handling, particularly if you subscribe to the ""a routine must have a single retur
n
statement"" school of programming (we don't). We've seen code that looks something lik
e
the following
:
                               
 
    retcode = OK;
    
if
 (socket.read(name) != OK) {
      retcode = BAD_READ;
    }
    
else
 {
      processName(name);
      
if
 (socket.read(address) != OK) {
        retcode = BAD_READ;
      }
      
else
 {
        processAddress(address);
        
if
 (socket.read(telNo) != OK) {
          retcode = BAD_READ;
        }
        
else
 {
          // 
etc, etc...
        }
      }
    }
    
return
 retcode;
Fortunately, if the programming language supports exceptions, you can rewrite this code in 
a far neater way:
                               
 
    retcode = OK;
    
try
 {
       socket.read(name);
      process(name);
      socket.read(address);
      processAddress(address);
      socket.read(telNo);
      // 
etc, etc...
    }
    
catch
 (IOException e) {
      retcode = BAD_READ;
      Logger.log(
""Error reading individual: ""
 + e.getMessage());
    }
    
return
 retcode;
The normal flow of control is now clear, with all the error handling moved off to a single 
place.
What Is Exceptional?
One of the problems with exceptions is knowing when to use them. We believe that 
exceptions should rarely be used as part of a program's normal flow; exceptions should be 
reserved for unexpected events. Assume that an uncaught exception will terminate your 
program and ask yourself, ""Will this code still run if I remove all the exception handlers?"" If 
the answer is ""no,"" then maybe exceptions are being used in nonexceptional 
circumstances.
For example, if your code tries to open a file for reading and that file does not exist, should 
an exception be raised?
Our answer is, ""It depends."" If the file 
should
 have been there, then an exception i
s
warranted. Something unexpected happened—a file you were expecting to exist seems t
o
have disappeared. On the other hand, if you have no idea whether the file should exist o
r
not, then it doesn't seem exceptional if you can't find it, and an error return is appropriate
.
Let's look at an example of the first case. The following code opens the file 
/etc/passwd,
which should exist on all Unix systems. If it fails, it passes on the 
FileNotFoundException
 to 
its caller.
                                       
 
     
public void
 open_passwd() 
throws
 FileNotFoundException {
      // 
This may throw FileNotFoundException...
      ipstream = 
new
 FileInputStream(""
/etc/passwd
"");
      // ...
    }
However, the second case may involve opening a file specified by the user on the 
command line. Here an exception isn't warranted, and the code looks different:
                                       
 
    
public boolean
 open_user_file(String name)
      
throws
 FileNotFoundException {
      File f = 
new
 File(name);
      
if
 (!f.exists()) {
        
return false;
      }
      ipstream = 
new
 FileInputStream(f);
      
return true;
    }
Note that the 
FileInputStream
 call can still generate an exception, which the routine passes 
on. However, the exception will be generated under only truly exceptional circumstances; 
simply trying to open a file that does not exist will generate a conventional error return.
Tip 34
Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems
Why do we suggest this approach to exceptions? Well, an exception represents a
n
immediate, nonlocal transfer of control—it's a kind of cascading
 
goto.
 Programs that use 
exceptions as part of their normal processing suffer from all the readability and 
maintainability problems of classic spaghetti code. These programs break encapsulation: 
 routines and their callers are more tightly coupled via exception handling.
Error Handlers Are an Alternative
An error handler is a routine that is called when an error is detected. You can register a 
routine to handle a specific category of errors. When one of these errors occurs, the 
handler will be called.
There are times when you may want to use error handlers, either instead of or alongside 
exceptions. Clearly, if you are using a language such as C, which does not support 
exceptions, this is one of your few other options (see the challenge on the next page). 
However, sometimes error handlers can be used even in languages (such as Java) that 
have a good exception handling scheme built in.
Consider the implementation of a client-server application, using Java's Remote Method 
Invocation (RMI) facility. Because of the way RMI is implemented, every call to a remote 
routine must be prepared to handle a 
RemoteException.
 Adding code to handle these 
exceptions can become tedious, and means that it is difficult to write code that works with 
both local and","[-0.001956363, 0.034748398, 0.010615212, 0.022529956, 0.037714723, 0.018645482, -0.01229613, -0.014577377, 0.028745117, 0.053648137, 0.07938455, -0.027177202, 0.0022989032,

" can become tedious, and means that it is difficult to write code that works with 
both local and remote routines. A possible work-around is to wrap your remote objects in a 
class that is not remote. This class then implements an error handler interface, allowing the 
client code to register a routine to be called when a remote exception is detected.

Challenges
Languages that do not support exceptions often have some other nonlocal transfer 
of control mechanism (C has 
longjmp/setjmp,
 for example). Consider how you 
could implement some kind of ersatz exception mechanism using these facilities. 
What are the benefits and dangers? What special steps do you need to take to 
ensure that resources are not orphaned? Does it make sense to use this kind of 
solution whenever you code in C?

How to Balance Resources
""I brought you into this world, "" my father would say,"" and I can take you out. It don't 
make no difference to me. I'll just make another one like you.""
Bill Cosby, 
Fatherhood
We all manage resources whenever we code: memory, transactions, threads, flies
,
timers—all kinds of things with limited availability. Most of the time, resource usage follow
s
a predictable pattern: you allocate the resource, use it, and then deallocate it
.
However, many developers have no consistent plan for dealing with resource allocation 
and deallocation. So let us suggest a simple tip:
Tip 35
Finish What You Start
This tip is easy to apply in most circumstances. It simply means that the routine or objec
t
that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it. Let's see how it applie
s
by looking at an example of some bad code—an application that opens a file, read
s
customer information from it, updates a field, and writes the result back. We've eliminate
d
error handling to make the example clearer
.
                               
 
    
void
 readCustomer(
const char
 *fName, Customer *cRec) {
      cFile = fopen(fName, ""
r+
"");
      fread(cRec, 
sizeof
(*cRec), 1, cFile);
    }
    
void
 writeCustomer(Customer *cRec) {
      rewind(cFile);
       fwrite (cRec, 
sizeof
(*cRec), 1, cFile);
      fclose(cFile);
    }
    
void
 updateCustomer(
const char
 *fName, 
double
 newBalance) {
      Customer cRec;
      readCustomer(fName, &cRec);
      cRec.balance = newBalance;
      writeCustomer(&cRec);
    }
At first sight, the routine 
updateCustomer
 looks pretty good. It seems to implement th
e
logic we require—reading a record, updating the balance, and writing the record back out
.
However, this tidiness hides a major problem. The routines
 
readCustomer
 and 
writeCustomer
 are tightly coupled
[3]
 —they share the global variable
 
cFile.readCustomer
opens the file and stores the file pointer in 
cFile,
 and 
writeCustomer
 uses that stored 
pointer to close the file when it finishes. This global variable doesn't even appear in the 
updateCustomer
 routine.
[3]
 For a discussion of the dangers of coupled code, see
 
Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
.
Why is this bad? Let's consider the unfortunate maintenance programmer who is told tha
t
the specification has changed—the balance should be updated only if the new value is no
t
negative. She goes into the source and changes
 
updateCustomer:
                               
 
    
void
 updateCustomer(
const char
 *fName, 
double
 newBalance) {
      Customer cRec;
      readCustomer(fName, &cRec);
      
if
 (newBalance >= 0.0) {
        cRec.balance = newBalance;
        writeCustomer(&cRec);
       }
    }
All seems fine during testing. However, when the code goes into production, it collapses 
after several hours, complaining of 
too many open files.
 Because 
writeBalance
 is not 
getting called in some circumstances, the file is not getting closed.
A very bad solution to this problem would be to deal with the special case in 
updateCustomer:
                               
 
    
void
 updateCustomer(
const char
 *fName, 
double
 newBalance) {
      Customer cRec;
      readCustomer(fName, &cRec);
      
if
 (newBalance >= 0.0) {
        cRec.balance = newBalance;
        writeCustomer(&cRec);
      }
      
else
        fclose(cFile);
    }
This will fix the problem—the file will now get closed regardless of the new balance—bu
t
the fix now means that
 
three
 routines are coupled through the global 
cFile.
 We're falling 
into a trap, and things are going to start going downhill rapidly if we continue on this 
course.
The 
finish what you start
 tip tells us that, ideally, the routine that allocates a resource 
should also free it. We can apply it here by refactoring the code slightly:
                               
 
    
void
 readCustomer(FILE *cFile, Customer *cRec) {
      fread(cRec, 
sizeof
(*cRec), 1, cFile);
    }
    
void
 writeCustomer(FILE *cFile, Customer *cRec) {
       rewind(cFile);
      fwrite(cRec, 
sizeof
(*cRec), 1, cFile);
    }
    
void
 updateCustomer(
const char
 *fName, 
double
 newBalance) {
      FILE *cFile;
      Customer cRec;
      cFile = fopen(fName, 
""r+"");    
  // >---
      readCustomer(cFile, &cRec);        //     /
      
if
 (newBalance >= 0.0) {           //     /
        cRec.balance = newBalance;       //     /
        writeCustomer(cFile, &cRec);     //     /
      }                                  //     /
      fclose(cFile);                     // <---
    }
Now all the responsibility for the file is in the 
updateCustomer
 routine. It opens the file and 
(finishing what it starts) closes it before exiting. The routine balances the use of the file: the 
open and close are in the same place, and it is apparent that for every open there will be a 
corresponding close. The refactoring also removes an ugly global variable.
Nest Allocations
The basic pattern for resource allocation can be extended for routines that need more than 
one resource at a time. There are just two more suggestions:

" There are just two more suggestions:
Deallocate resources in the opposite order to that in which you allocate them. That 
way you won't orphan resources if one resource contains references to another.
1
.
When allocating the same set of resources in different places in your code, always 
allocate them in the same order. This will reduce the possibility of deadlock. (If 
process A claims 
resource1
 and is about to claim 
resource2,
 while process B has 
claimed 
resource2
 and is trying to get 
resource1,
 the two processes will wait 
forever.)
2
.
It doesn't matter what kind of resources we're using—transactions, memory, files, threads
,
windows—the basic pattern applies: whoever allocates a resource should be responsibl
e
for deallocating it. However, in some languages we can develop the concept further
.

Objects and Exceptions
The equilibrium between allocations and deallocations is reminiscent of a class's 
constructor and destructor. The class represents a resource, the constructor gives you a 
particular object of that resource type, and the destructor removes it from your scope.
If you are programming in an object-oriented language, you may find it useful to 
encapsulate resources in classes. Each time you need a particular resource type, you 
instantiate an object of that class. When the object goes out of scope, or is reclaimed by 
the garbage collector, the object's destructor then deallocates the wrapped resource.
This approach has particular benefits when you're working with languages such as C++, 
where exceptions can interfere with resource deallocation.

Balancing and Exceptions
Languages that support exceptions can make resource deallocation tricky. If an exception 
is thrown, how do you guarantee that everything allocated prior to the exception is tidied 
up? The answer depends to some extent on the language.
Balancing Resources with C++ Exceptions
C++ supports a 
try…catc
h
 exception mechanism. Unfortunately, this means that there are 
always at least two possible paths when exiting a routine that catches and then rethrows 
an exception:
                                       
 
    
void
 doSomething(
void
) {
      Node *n = 
new
 Node;
      try {
        // 
do something
      }
      catch (...) {
        
delete
 n;
        throw;
      }
      
delete
 n;
    }
Notice that the node we create is freed in two places—once in the routine's normal exi
t
path, and once in the exception handler. This is an obvious violation of the
 
DRY
 principle 
and a maintenance problem waiting to happen.
However, we can use the semantics of C++ to our advantage. Local objects are 
automatically destroyed on exiting from their enclosing block. This gives us a couple of 
options. If the circumstances permit, we can change ""n"" from a pointer to an actual Node 
object on the stack:
                                       
 
     
void
 doSomething1(
void
) {
      Node n;
      try {
        // 
do something
      }
      catch (...) {
        throw;
      }
    }
Here we rely on C++ to handle the destruction of the 
Node
 object automatically, whether 
an exception is thrown or not.
If the switch from a pointer is not possible, the same effect can be achieved by wrapping 
the resource (in this case, a 
Node
 pointer) within another class.
                                       
 
    // 
Wrapper class for Node resources
    
class
 NodeResource {
      Node *n;
     
public:
      NodeResource() { n = 
new
 Node; }
      ~NodeResource() { 
delete
 n; }
      Node *
operator
->() { 
return
 n; }
    };
    
void
 doSomething2(
void
) {
      NodeResource n;
      try {
        // 
do something
      }
      catch (...) {
        throw;
      }
    }
 Now the wrapper class, 
NodeResource,
 ensures that when its objects are destroyed the 
corresponding nodes are also destroyed. For convenience, the wrapper provides a 
dereferencing operator 
->,
 so that its users can access the fields in the contained Node 
object directly.
Because this technique is so useful, the standard C++ library provides the template class 
auto_ptr,
 which gives you automatic wrappers for dynamically allocated objects.
                                       
 
    
void
 doSomething3(
void
) {
      auto_ptr<Node> p 
(new
 Node);
      // 
Access the Node as p->...
      // 
Node automatically deleted
 at 
end
    }
Balancing Resources in Java
Unlike C++, Java implements a lazy form of automatic object destruction. Unreferenced 
objects are considered to be candidates for garbage collection, and their 
finalize
 method 
will get called should garbage collection ever claim them. While a convenience for 
developers, who no longer get the blame for most memory leaks, it makes it difficult to 
implement resource clean-up using the C++ scheme. Fortunately, the designers of the 
Java language thoughtfully added a language feature to compensate, the 
finally
 clause. 
When a 
try
 block contains a 
finally
 clause, code in that clause is guaranteed to be 
executed if any statement in the 
try
 block is executed. It doesn't matter whether an 
exception is thrown (or even if the code in the 
try
 block executes a 
return
)—the code in th
e
finally
 clause will get run. This means we can balance our resource usage with code such 
as
                                       
 
    
public void
 doSomething() 
throws
 IOException {
      File tmpFile = 
new
 File(tmpFileName);
      FileWriter tmp = 
new
 FileWriter(tmpFile);
      
try
 {
        // 
do some work
      }
      
finally
 {
         tmpFile.delete();
      }
    }
The routine uses a temporary file, which we want to delete, regardless of how the routine 
exits. The 
finally
 block allows us to express this concisely.

When You Can't Balance Resources
There are times when the basic resource allocation pattern just isn't appropriate. 
Commonly this is found in programs that use dynamic data structures. One routine will 
allocate an area of memory and link it into some larger structure, where it may stay for 
some time.
The trick here is to establish a semantic invariant for memory allocation. You need to 
decide who is responsible for data in an aggregate data structure. What happens when you 
deallocate the top-level structure? You have three main options:
The top-level structure is also responsible for freeing any substructures that it 
contains. These structures then recursively delete data they contain, and so on.
1
.
The top-level structure is simply deallocated. Any structures that it pointed to (that 
are not referenced elsewhere) are orphaned.
2
.
The top-level structure refuses to deallocate itself if it contains any substructures.
3
.
The choice here depends on the circumstances of each individual data structure. However, 
you need to make it explicit for each, and implement your decision consistently. 
Implementing any of these options in a procedural language such as C can","[0.02105808, 0.05527914, 0.02780042, 0.034180846, 0.022465529, 0.014503402, -0.0019586964, -0.009610849, 0.019047443,

" implement your decision consistently. 
Implementing any of these options in a procedural language such as C can be a problem: 
data structures themselves are not active. Our preference in these circumstances is to 
write a module for each major structure that provides standard allocation and deallocation 
facilities for that structure. (This module can also provide facilities such as debug printing, 
serialization, deserialization, and traversal hooks.)
Finally, if keeping track of resources gets tricky, you can write your own form of limited 
automatic garbage collection by implementing a reference counting scheme on your 
dynamically allocated objects. The book 
More Effective C++
 [
Mey96
] dedicates a section 
to this topic.

Checking the Balance
Because Pragmatic Programmers trust no one, including ourselves, we feel that it is 
always a good idea to build code that actually checks that resources are indeed freed 
appropriately. For most applications, this normally means producing wrappers for each 
type of resource, and using these wrappers to keep track of all allocations and 
deallocations. At certain points in your code, the program logic will dictate that the 
resources will be in a certain state: use the wrappers to check this.
For example, a long-running program that services requests will probably have a single 
point at the top of its main processing loop where it waits for the next request to arrive. This 
is a good place to ensure that resource usage has not increased since the last execution of 
the loop.
At a lower, but no less useful level, you can invest in tools that (among other things) check 
your running programs for memory leaks. Purify (
http://www.rational.com
) and Insure++ 
(
http://www.parasoft.com
) are popular choices.

Challenges
Although there are no guaranteed ways of ensuring that you always free resources, 
certain design techniques, when applied consistently, will help. In the text we 
discussed how establishing a semantic invariant for major data structures could 
direct memory deallocation decisions. Consider how

Chapter 5. Bend or Brea

Life doesn't stand still.
Neither can the code that we write. In order to keep up with today's near-frantic pace o
f
change, we need to make every effort to write code that's as loose—as flexible—a
s
possible. Otherwise we may find our code quickly becoming outdated, or too brittle to fix
,
and may ultimately be left behind in the mad dash toward the future
.
In 
Reversibility
, we talked about the perils of irreversible decisions. In this chapter, we'll tell 
you how to make 
reversible
 decisions, so your code can stay flexible and adaptable in the 
face of an uncertain world.
First we need to look at 
coupling
—
the dependencies among modules of code. In 
Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
 we'll show how to keep separate concepts separate, 
and decrease coupling.
A good way to stay flexible is to write 
less
 code. Changing code leaves you open to the 
possibility of introducing new bugs. 
Metaprogramming
 will explain how to move details out 
of the code completely, where they can be changed more safely and easily.
In 
Temporal Coupling,
 we'll look at two aspects of time as they relate to coupling. Do you 
depend on the ""tick"" coming before the ""tock""? Not if you want to stay flexible.
A key concept in creating flexible code is the separation of a data 
model
 from a 
view,
 or 
presentation, of that model. We'll decouple models from views in 
It's Just a View.
Finally, there's a technique for decoupling modules even further by providing a meeting 
place where modules can exchange data anonymously and asynchronously. This is the 
topic of 
Blackboards.
Armed with these techniques, you can write code that will ""roll with the punches.""

Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
Good fences make good neighbors.
Robert Frost, ""Mending Wall""
In 
Orthogonality
, and 
Design by Contract
, we suggested that writing ""shy"" code is 
beneficial. But ""shy"" works two ways: don't reveal yourself to others, and don't interact with 
too many people.
Spies, dissidents, revolutionaries, and such are often organized into small groups of people 
called 
cells.
 Although individuals in each cell may know each other, they have no 
knowledge of those in other cells. If one cell is discovered, no amount of truth serum will 
reveal the names of others outside the cell. Eliminating interactions between cells protects 
everyone.
We feel that this is a good principle to apply to coding as well. Organize your code into 
cells (modules) and limit the interaction between them. If one module then gets 
compromised and has to be replaced, the other modules should be able to carry on.
Minimize Coupling
What's wrong with having modules that know about each other? Nothing in principle—w
e
don't need to be as paranoid as spies or dissidents. However, you do need to be carefu
l
about
 
how many
 other modules you interact with and, more importantly, 
how
 you came to 
interact with them.
Suppose you are remodeling your house, or building a house from scratch. A typica
l
arrangement involves a ""general contractor."" You hire the contractor to get the work done
,
but the contractor may or may not do the construction personally; the work may be offere
d
to various subcontractors. But as the client, you are not involved in dealing with th
e
subcontractors directly—the general contractor assumes that set of headaches on you
r
behalf
.
We'd like to follow this same model in software. When we ask an object for a particular 
service, we'd like the service to be performed on our behalf. We 
do not
 want the object to 
give us a third-party object that we have to deal with to get the required service.
 For example, suppose you are writing a class that generates a graph of scientific recorder 
data. You have data recorders spread around the world; each recorder object contains a 
location object giving its position and time zone. You want to let your users select a 
recorder and plot its data, labeled with the correct time zone. You might write

" with the correct time zone. You might write
                                       
 
     
public void
 plotDate(Date aDate, Selection aSelection) {
       TimeZone tz =
          aSelection.getRecorder().getLocation().getTimeZone();
       ...
     }
But now the plotting routine is unnecessarily coupled to 
three
 classes—
 
Selection, 
Recorder,
 and 
Location.
 This style of coding dramatically increases the number of classes 
on which our class depends. Why is this a bad thing? It increases the risk that an unrelated 
change somewhere else in the system will affect 
your
 code. For instance, if Fred makes a 
change to 
Location
 such that it no longer directly contains a 
TimeZone,
 you have to change 
your code as well.
Rather than digging though a hierarchy yourself, just ask for what you need directly:
                                       
 
     
public void
 plotDate(Date aDate, TimeZone aTz) {
       ...
     }
     plotDate(someDate, someSelection.getTimeZone());
We added a method to 
Selection
 to get the time zone on our behalf: the plotting routine 
doesn't care whether the time zone comes from the 
Recorder
 directly, from some 
contained object within 
Recorder,
 or whether 
Selection
 makes up a different time zone 
entirely. The selection routine, in turn, should probably just ask the recorder for its time 
zone, leaving it up to the recorder to get it from its contained 
Location
 object.
Traversing relationships between objects directly can quickly lead to a combinatorial 
explosion
[1]

Systems with many unnecessary dependencies are very hard (and expensive) to maintain, 
and tend to be highly unstable. In order to keep the dependencies to a minimum, we'll use 
the 
Law of Demeter
 to design our methods and functions.
The Law of Demeter for Functions
The Law of Demeter for functions [
LH89
] attempts to minimize coupling between modules 
in any given program. It tries to prevent you from reaching into an object to gain access to 
a third object's methods. The law is summarized in 
Figure 5.1
 on the next page.
Figure 5.1. Law of Demeter for functions
By writing ""shy"" code that honors the Law of Demeter as much as possible, we can achieve 
our objective:
 Tip 36
Minimize Coupling Between Modules
Does It Really Make a Difference?
While it sounds good in theory, does following the Law of Demeter really help to create 
more maintainable code?
Studies have shown [
BBM96
] that classes in C++ with larger 
response sets
 are more 
prone to error than classes with smaller response sets (a 
response set
 is defined to be the 
number of functions directly invoked by methods of the class).
Because following the Law of Demeter reduces the size of the response set in the calling 
class, it follows that classes designed in this way will also tend to have fewer errors (see 
[
URL 56
] for more papers and information on the Demeter project).
Using The Law of Demeter will make your code more adaptable and robust, but at a cost
:
as a ""general contractor,"" your module must delegate and manage any and al
l
subcontractors directly, without involving clients of your module. In practice, this mean
s
that you will be writing a large number of wrapper methods that simply forward the reques
t
on to a delegate. These wrapper methods will impose both a runtime cost and a spac
e
overhead, which may be significant—even prohibitive—in some applications
.
As with any technique, you must balance the pros and cons for 
your
 particular application. 
In database schema design it is common practice to ""denormalize"" the schema for a 
performance improvement: to violate the rules of normalization in exchange for speed. A 
similar tradeoff can be made here as well. In fact, by reversing the Law of Demeter and 
tightly
 coupling several modules, you may realize an important performance gain. As long 
as it is well known and acceptable for those modules to be coupled, your design is fine.
Physical Decoupling
 In this section we're concerned largely with designing to keep things logically 
decoupled within systems. However, there is another kind of interdependence 
that becomes highly significant as systems grow larger.In his book 
Large-scale 
C++ software Design
 [
Lak96
], John Lakos addresses the issues surrounding 
the relationships among the files, directories, and libraries that make up a 
system. Large projects that ignore these 
physical design
 problems wind up wit
h
build cycles that are measured in days and unit tests that may drag in the entir
e
system as support code, among other problems. Mr. Lakos argues convincingl
y
that logical and physical design must proceed in tandem—that undoing th
e
damage done to a large body of code by cyclic dependencies is extremel
y
difficult. We recommend this book if you are involved in large-scal
e
developments, even if C++ isn't your implementation language
.
Otherwise, you may find yourself on the road to a brittle, inflexible future. Or no future at all.

Challenges
We've discussed how using delegation makes it easier to obey the Law of Demeter 
and hence reduce coupling. However, writing all of the methods needed to forward 
calls to delegated classes is boring and error prone. What are the advantages and 
disadvantages of writing a preprocessor that generates these calls automatically? 
Should this preprocessor be run only once, or should it be used as part of the 
build?
 Exercises

We discussed the concept of physical decoupling in the box on on the facing 
page. Which of the following C++ header flies is more tightly coupled to the 
rest of the system?
person1.h
person2.h:
#include
 
""date.h""
class
 Person1 {
private:
  Date myBirthdate;
public:
  Person1(Date &birthDate);
  // ...
  
class
 Date;
class
 Person2 {
private:
  Date *myBirthdate;
public:
  Person2(Date &birthDate);
  // ...

method calls shown are allowed according to the Law of Demeter. This first 
one is in Java

Metaprogramming
No amount of genius can overcome a preoccupation with detail
Levy's Eighth Law
Details mess up our pristine code—especially if they change frequently. Every time w
e
have to go in and change the code to accommodate some change in business logic, or i
n
the law, or in management's personal tastes of the day, we run the risk of breaking th
e
system—of introducing a new bug
.
So we say ""out with the details!"" Get them out of the code. While we're at it, we can mak
e
our code highly configurable and ""soft""—that is, easily adaptable to changes
.
Dynamic Configuration
First, we want to make our systems highly configurable. Not just things such as screen 
colors and prompt text, but deeply ingrained items such as the choice of algorithms, 
database products, middleware technology, and user-interface style. These items should 
be implemented as configuration options, not through integration or engineering.
Tip 37
Configure, Don't Integrate
Use 
metadata
 to describe configuration options for an application: tuning parameters, user 
preferences, the installation directory, and so on.
What exactly is metadata? Strictly speaking, metadata is data about data. The most 
common example is probably a database schema or data dictionary. A schema contains 
data that describes fields (columns) in terms of names, storage lengths, and other 
attributes. You should be able to access and manipulate this information just as you would 
any other data in the database.
 We use the term in its broadest sense. Metadata is any data that describes th
e
application—how it should run, what resources it should use, and so on. Typically
,
metadata is accessed and used at runtime, not at compile time. You use metadata all th
e
time—at least your programs do. Suppose you click on an option to hide the toolbar o
n
your Web browser. The browser will store that preference, as metadata, in some sort o
f
internal database
.
This database might be in a proprietary format, or it might use a standard mechanism. 
Under Windows, either an initialization file (using the suffix 
.ini
) or entries in the system 
Registry are typical. Under Unix, the X Window System provides similar functionality using 
Application Default files. Java uses Property files. In all of these environments, you specify 
a key to retrieve a value. Alternatively, more powerful and flexible implementations of 
metadata use an embedded scripting language (see 
Domain Languages
, for details).
The Netscape browser has actually implemented preferences using both of these 
techniques. In Version 3, preferences were saved as simple key/value pairs:
                                       
 
     SHOW_TOOLBAR: False
Later, Version 4 preferences looked more like JavaScript:
                                       
 
     user_pref(""custtoolbar.Browser.Navigation_Toolbar.open"", false);
Metadata-Driven Applications
But we want to go beyond using metadata for simple preferences. We want to configure 
and drive the application via metadata as much as possible. Our goal is to think 
declaratively (specifying 
what
 is to be done, not 
how)
 and create highly dynamic an
d
adaptable programs. We do this by adopting a general rule: program for the general case
,
and put the specifics somewhere else—outside the compiled code base
.
Tip 38
Put Abstractions in Code Details in Metadata
 There are several benefits to this approach:
It forces you to decouple your design, which results in a more flexible and 
adaptable program.
It forces you to create a more robust, abstract design by deferrin
g
details—deferring them all the way out of the program
.
You can customize the application without recompiling it. You can also use this 
level of customization to provide easy work-arounds for critical bugs in live 
production systems.
Metadata can be expressed in a manner that's much closer to the problem domain 
than a general-purpose programming language might be (see 
Domain Languages
).
You may even be able to implement several different projects using the same 
application engine, but with different metadata.
We want to defer definition of most details until the last moment, and leave the details a
s
soft—as easy to change—as we can. By crafting a solution that allows us to make change
s
quickly, we stand a better chance of coping with the flood of directional shifts that swam
p
many projects (see
 
Reversibility
).
Business Logic
So you've made the choice of database engine a configuration option, and provided 
metadata to determine the user-interface style. Can we do more? Definitely.
Because business policy and rules are more likely to change than any other aspect of the 
project, it makes sense to maintain them in a very flexible format.
For example, your purchasing application may include various corporate policies. Maybe 
you pay small suppliers in 45 days and large ones in 90 days. Make the definitions of the 
supplier types, as well as the time periods themselves, configurable. Take the opportunity 
to generalize.
Maybe you are writing a system with horrendous workflow requirements. Actions start and 
stop according to complex (and changing) business rules. Consider encoding them in 
some kind of rule-based (or expert) system, embedded within your application. That way, 
you'll configure it by writing rules, not cutting code.
 Less complex logic can be expressed using a mini-language, removing the need to 
recompile and redeploy when the environment changes. Have a look at page 58 for an 
example.
When to Configure
As mentioned in 
The power of plain Text
, we recommend representin
g
configuration metadata in plain text—it makes life that much easier
.
But when should a program read this configuration? Many programs will scan 
such things only at startup, which is unfortunate. If you need to change the 
configuration, this forces you to restart the application. A more flexible approach 
is to write programs that can reload their configuration while they're running. This

"the program is running. For a small client GUI application that restarts quickly, 
you may not need to.
This phenomenon is not limited to application code. We've all been annoyed at 
operating systems that force us to reboot when we install some simple 
application or change an innocuous parameter.
An Example: Enterprise Java Beans
Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) is a framework for simplifying programming in a distributed, 
transaction-based environment. We mention it here because EJB illustrates how metadata 
can be used both to configure applications 
and
 to reduce the complexity of writing code.
Suppose you want to create some Java software that will participate in transactions across 
different machines, between different database vendors, and with different thread and 
load-balancing models.
The good news is, you don't have to worry about all that. You write a 
bean
—
a
self-contained object that follows certain conventions—and place it in a
 
bean container
that manages much of the low-level detail on your behalf. You can write the code for a 
 bean without including any transaction operations or thread management; EJB uses 
metadata to specify how transactions should be handled.
Thread allocation and load balancing are specified as metadata to the underlying 
transaction service that the container uses. This separation allows us great flexibility to 
configure the environment dynamically, at runtime.
The bean's container can manage transactions on the bean's behalf in one of several 
different styles (including an option where you control your own commits and rollbacks). All 
of the parameters that affect the bean's behavior are specified in the bean's 
deploymen
t
descriptor
—
a serialized object that contains the metadata we need.
Distributed systems such as EJB are leading the way into a new world of configurable, 
dynamic systems.
Cooperative Configuration
We've talked about users and developers configuring dynamic applications. But wha
t
happens if you let applications configure each other—software that adapts itself to it
s
environment? Unplanned, spur-of-the-moment configuration of existing software is 
a
powerful concept
.
Operating systems already configure themselves to hardware as they boot, and Web 
browsers update themselves with new components automatically.
Your larger applications probably already have issues with handling different versions of 
data and different releases of libraries and operating systems. Perhaps a more dynamic 
approach will help.
Don't Write Dodo-Code
Without metadata, your code is not as adaptable or flexible as it could be. Is this a bad 
thing? Well, out here in the real world, species that don't adapt die.
The dodo didn't adapt to the presence of humans and their livestock on the island of 
Mauritius, and quickly became extinct.
[2]
 It was the first documented extinction of a specie
s
at the hand of man.
[2]
 It didn't help that the settlers beat the placid (read
 
stupid
) birds to death with clubs for sport.
 Don't let your project (or your career) go the way of the dodo.

Challenges
For your current project, consider how much of the application might be moved out 
of the program itself to metadata. What would the resultant ""engine"" look like? 
Would you be able to reuse that engine in the context of a different application?

Temporal Coupling
What is 
temporal coupling
 all about, you may ask. It's about time.
Time is an often ignored aspect of software architectures. The only time that preoccupies us is th
e
time on the schedule, the time left until we ship—but this is not what we're talking about here. Instead
,
we are talking about the role of time as a design element of the software itself. There are two aspect
s
of time that are important to us: concurrency (things happening at the same time) and ordering (th
e
relative positions of things in time)
.
We don't usually approach programming with either of these aspects in mind. When people first si
t
down to design an architecture or write a program, things tend to be linear. That's the way most peopl
e
think
—
do this
 and then always 
do that.
 But thinking this way leads to 
temporal coupling:
 coupling in 
time. Method A must always be called before method B; only one report can be run at a time; you 
must wait for the screen to redraw before the button click is received. Tick must happen before tock.
This approach is not very flexible, and not very realistic.
We need to allow for concurrency
[3]
 and to think about decoupling any time or order dependencies. I
n
doing so, we can gain flexibility and reduce any time-based dependencies in many areas of 
development: workflow analysis, architecture, design, and deployment.
[3]
 We won't go into the details of concurrent or parallel programming here; a good computer scienc
e
textbook should cover the basics, including scheduling, deadlock, star-vation, mutual 
exclusion/semaphores, and so on.
Workflow
On many projects, we need to model and analyze the users' workflows as part of requirements 
analysis. We'd like to find out what 
can
 happen at the same time, and what must happen in a strict 
order. One way to do this is to capture their description of workflow using a notation such as the 
UML 
activity diagram.
[4]
[4]
 For more information on all of the UML diagram types, see 
[
FS97
].
An activity diagram consists of a set of actions drawn as rounded boxes. The arrow leaving an action 
leads to either another action (which can start once the first action completes) or to a thick line called a 
synchronization bar.
 Once 
all
 the actions leading into a synchronization bar are complete, you can 
then proceed along any arrows leaving the bar. An action with no arrows leading into it can be started 
at any time.
You can use activity diagrams to maximize parallelism by identifying activities that 
could be
 performed 
in parallel, but aren't.

Even though they describe these actions serially, and may even perform them serially, we notice that 
many of them could be performed in parallel, as we show in the activity diagram in

 It can be eye-opening to see where the dependencies really exist. In this instance, the top-level tasks 
(1, 2, 4, 10, and 11) can all happen concurrently, up front. Tasks 3, 5, and 6 can happen in parallel 
later.
If you were in a piña colada-making contest, these optimizations may make all the difference

Architecture
We wrote an On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) system a few years ago. At its simplest, all the 
system had to do was read a request and process the transaction against the database. But we wrote 
a three-tier, multiprocessing distributed application: each component was an independent entity that 
ran concurrently with all other components. While this sounds like more work, it wasn't: taking 
advantage of temporal decoupling made it 
easier
 to write. Let's take a closer look at this project.
The system takes in requests from a large number of data communication lines and processes 
transactions against a back-end database.
The design addresses the following constraints:
Database operations take a relatively long time to complete.
 For each transaction, we must not block communication services while a database transaction 
is being processed.
Database performance suffers with too many concurrent sessions.
Multiple transactions are in progress concurrently on each data line.
The solution that gave us the best performance and cleanest architecture looked something like 
Figure 
5.3
.
Figure 5.3. OLTP architecture overview
Each box represents a separate process; processes communicate via work queues. Each input 
process monitors one incoming communication line, and makes requests to the application server. All 
requests are asynchronous: as soon as the input process makes its current request, it goes back to 
monitoring the line for more traffic. Similarly, the application server makes requests of the database 
process,
[5]
 and is notified when the individual transaction is complete
.
[5]
 Even though we show the database as a single, monolithic entity, it is not. The database software i
s
partitioned into several processes and client threads, but this is handled internally by the database 
software and isn't part of our example.
This example also shows a way to get quick and dirty load balancing among multiple consumer 
processes: the 
hungry consumer
 model.
In a hungry consumer model, you replace the central scheduler with a number of independent 
consumer tasks and a centralized work queue. Each consumer task grabs a piece from the work 
queue and goes on about the business of processing it. As each task finishes its work, it goes back to 
the queue for some more. This way, if any particular task gets bogged down, the others can pick up 
the slack, and each individual component can proceed at its own pace. Each component is temporally 
decoupled from the others.

Design Using Services
 Instead of components, we have really created 
services
—
independent, concurrent objects behind 
well-defined, consistent interfaces.
Design for Concurrency
The rising acceptance of Java as a platform has exposed more developers to multithreade
d
programming. But programming with threads imposes some design constraints—and that's a goo
d
thing. Those constraints are actually so helpful that we want to abide by them whenever we program
.
It will help us decouple our code and fight
 
programming by coincidence
.
With linear code, it's easy to make assumptions that lead to sloppy programming. But concurrenc
y
forces you to think through things a bit more carefully—you're not alone at the party anymore
.
Because things can now happen at the ""same time,"" you may suddenly see some time-base
d
dependencies
.
To begin with, any global or static variables must be protected from concurrent access. Now may be a 
good time to ask yourself 
why
 you need a global variable in the first place. In addition, you need to 
make sure that you present consistent state information, regardless of the order of calls. For example, 
when is it valid to query the state of your object? If your object is in an invalid state between certain 
calls, you may be relying on a coincidence that no one can call your object at that point in time.
Suppose you have a windowing subsystem where the widgets are first created and then shown on the 
display in two separate steps. You aren't allowed to set state in the widget until it is shown. Depending 
on how the code is set up, you may be relying on the fact that no other object can use the created 
widget until you've shown it on the screen.
But this may not be true in a concurrent system. Objects must always be in a valid state when called, 
and they can be called at the most awkward times. You must ensure that an object is in a valid state 
any time
 it could possibly be called. Often this problem shows up with classes that define separate 
constructor and initialization routines (where the constructor doesn't leave the object in an initialized 
state). Using class invariants, discussed in 
Design by Contract
, will help you avoid this trap.
Cleaner Interfaces
Thinking about concurrency and time-ordered dependencies can lead you to design cleaner interfaces 
as well. Consider the C library routine 
strtok,
 which breaks a string into tokens.
The design of 
strtok
 isn't thread safe,
[6]
 but that isn't the worst part: look at the time dependency. Yo
u
must make the first call to 
strtok
 with the variable you want to parse, and all successive calls with a 
NULL
 instead. If you pass in a non-
NULL
 value, it restarts the parse on that buffer instead. Without 
even considering threads, suppose you wanted to use 
strtok
 to parse two separate strings at the same 
time:
[6]
 It uses static data to maintain the current position in the buffer. The static data isn't protected agains
t
 concurrent access, so it isn't thread safe. In addition, it clobbers the first argument you pass in, which can
lead to some nasty surprises.
                                               
 
    char
 buf1[BUFSIZ];
    char
 buf2[BUFSIZ];
    char
 *p, *q;
    strcpy(buf1, ""
this is a test
"");
    strcpy(buf2, ""
this ain't gonna work
"");
    p = strtok(buf1, "" "");
    q = strtok(buf2, "" "");
    while
 (p && q) {
      printf(
""%s %s
\
n"",
 p, q);
      p = strtok(NULL, "" "");
      q = strtok(NULL, "" "");
    }
The code as shown will not work: there is implicit state retained in 
strtok
 between calls. You have to 
use 
strtok
 on just one buffer at","[0.006659345, -0.00731005, 0.0016708933, 0.0020126866, 0.040869825, 0.028935615, 0.0074484977, -0.008230729, -0.018496642, 0.027578825, 0.09580596, 0.015312339, 0.0016830075,

Tip 41
Always Design for Concurrency
Deployment
 Once you've designed an architecture with an element of concurrency, it becomes easier to think 
about handling 
many
 concurrent services: the model becomes pervasive.
Now you can be flexible as to how the application is deployed: standalone, client-server, or 
n
-tier. B
y
architecting your system as independent services, you can make the configuration dynamic as well. B
y
planning for concurrency, and decoupling operations in time, you have all these options—including th
e
stand-alone option, where you can choose
 
not
 to be concurrent.
Going the other way (trying to add concurrency to a nonconcurrent application) is 
much
 harder. If w
e
design to allow for concurrency, we can more easily meet scalability or performance requirement
s
when the time comes—and if the time never comes, we still have the benefit of a cleaner design
.
Isn't it about time?

It's Just a View
Still, a man hears
What he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
La la la
…
Simon and Garfunkel, ""The Boxer""
Early on we are taught not to write a program as a single big chunk, but that we should ""divide and 
conquer"" and separate a program into modules. Each module has its own responsibilities; in fact, a 
good definition of a module (or class) is that it has a single, well-defined responsibility.
But once you separate a program into different modules based on responsibility, you have a ne
w
problem. At runtime, how do the objects talk to each other? How do you manage the logica
l
dependencies between them? That is, how do you synchronize changes in state (or updates to dat
a
values) in these different objects? It needs to be done in a clean, flexible manner—we don't want the
m
to know too much about each other. We want each module to be like the man in the song and jus
t
hear what it wants to hear
.
We'll start off with the concept of an 
event
. An event is simply a special message that says ""something 
interesting just happened"" (interesting, of course, lies in the eye of the beholder). We can use events 
to signal changes in one object that some other object may be interested in.
Using events in this way minimizes coupling between those objects—the sender of the event doesn'
t
need to have any explicit knowledge of the receiver. In fact, there could be multiple receivers, eac
h
one focused on its own agenda (of which the sender is blissfully unaware)
.
We need to exercise some care in using events, however. In an early version of Java, for example, 
one routine received 
all
 the events destined for a particular application. Not exactly the road to easy 
maintenance or evolution.
Publish/Subscribe
Why is it bad to push all the events through a single routine? It violates object encapsulation—that on
e
routine now has to have intimate knowledge of the interactions among many objects. It also increase
s
the coupling—and we're trying to
 
decrease
 coupling. Because the objects themselves have to have 
knowledge of these events as well, you are probably going to violate the 
DRY
 principle, orthogonality
,
and perhaps even sections of the Geneva Convention. You may have seen this kind of code—it i
s
 usually dominated by a huge
 
case
 statement or multiway 
if-then.
 We can do better.
Objects should be able to register to receive only the events they need, and should never be sent 
events they don't need. We don't want to spam our objects! Instead, we can use a 
publish/subscribe
protocol, illustrated using the 
UML sequence diagram
 in 
Figure 5.4
 on the next page.
[7]
[7]
 See also the Observer pattern in 
[
GHJV95
] for more information.
Figure 5.4. Publish/subscribe protocol
A sequence diagram shows the flow of messages among several objects, with objects arranged in 
columns. Each message is shown as a labeled arrow from the sender's column to the receiver's 
column. An asterisk in the label means that more than one message of this type can be sent.
If we are interested in certain events generated by a 
Publisher,
 all we have to do is register ourselves. 
The 
Publisher
 keeps track of all interested 
Subscriber
 objects; when the 
Publisher
 generates an event 
of interest, it will call each 
Subscriber
 in turn and notify them that the event has occurred.
There are several variations on this theme—mirroring other communication styles. Objects may us
e
publish/subscribe on a peer-to-peer basis (as we saw above); they may use a ""software bus"" where 
a
centralized object maintains the database of listeners and dispatches messages appropriately. Yo
u
might even have a scheme where critical events get broadcast to all listeners—registered or not. On
e
possible implementation of events in a distributed environment is illustrated by the CORBA Even
t
Service, described in the box on the following page
.
We can use this publish/subscribe mechanism to implement a very important design concept: the 
separation of a model from views of the model. Let's start with a GUI-based example, using the 
 Smalltalk design in which this concept was born.
Model-View-Controller
Suppose you have a spreadsheet application. In addition to the numbers in the spreadsheet itself, you 
also have a graph that displays the numbers as a bar chart and a running total dialog box that shows 
the sum of a column in the spreadsheet.
The CORBA Event Service
The CORBA Event Service allows participating objects to send and receive 
event notifications via a common bus, the 
event channel.
 The event channel 
arbitrates event handling, and also decouples event producers from event 
consumers. It works in two basic ways: 
push
 and 
pull.
In push mode, event suppliers inform the event channel that an event has 
occurred","[-0.02913123, 0.014565615, 0.007563726, 0.038401537, 0.031912323, 0.03587327, -0.02259988, -0.009719774, 0.006633184, 0.02404661, 0.066802375, -0.032923628, 0.0073600602, 0.011194595,

pull.
In push mode, event suppliers inform the event channel that an event has 
occurred. The channel then automatically distributes that event to all client 
objects that have registered interest.
In pull mode, clients periodically poll the event channel, which in turn polls the 
supplier that offers event data corresponding to the request.
Although the CORBA Event Service can be used to implement all of the event 
models discussed in this section, you can also view it as a different animal. 
CORBA facilities communication among objects written in different programming 
languages running on geographically dispersed machines with different 
architectures. Sitting on top of CORBA, the event service give you a decoupled 
way of interacting with applications around the world, written by people you've 
never met, using programming languages you'd rather not know about.
Obviously, we don't want to have three separate copies of the data. So we create a 
model
—
the data 
itself, with common operations to manipulate it. Then we can create separate 
views
 that display the 
data in different ways: as a spreadsheet, as a graph, or in a totals box. Each of these views may have 
its own 
controller.
 The graph view may have a controller that allows you to zoom in or out, or pan 
around the data, for example. None of this affects the data itself, just that view.
This is the key concept behind the Model-View-Controller (MVC0 idiom: separating the model from 
both the GUI that represents it and the controls that manage the view.
[8]
 [8]
 The view and controller are tightly coupled, and in some Implementations of MVC the view an
d
controller are a single component.
By doing so, you can take advantage of some interesting possibilities. You can support multiple views 
of the same data model. You can use common viewers on many different data models. You can even 
support multiple controllers to provide nontraditional input mechanisms.
Tip 42
Separate Views from Models
By loosening the coupling between the model and the view/controller, you buy yourself a lot of 
flexibility at low cost. In fact, this technique is one of the most important ways of maintaining 
reversibility (see 
Reversibility
).
Java Tree View
A good example of an MVC design can be found in the Java tree widget. The tree widget (which 
displays a clickable, traversable tree) is actually a set of several different classes organized in an MVC 
pattern.
To produce a fully functional tree widget, all you need to do is provide a data source that conforms to 
the 
TreeModel
 interface. Your code now becomes the model for the tree.
The view is created by the 
TreeCellRenderer
 and 
TreeCellEditor
 classes, which can be inherited from 
and customized to provide different colors, fonts, and icons in the widget. 
JTree
 acts as the controller 
for the tree widget and provides some general viewing functionality.
Because we have decoupled the model from the view, we simplify the programming a great deal. You 
don't have to think about programming a tree widget anymore. Instead, you just provide a data source.
Suppose the vice president comes up to you and wants a quick application that lets her navigate the 
company's organizational chart, which is held in a legacy database on the mainframe. Just write a 
wrapper that takes the mainframe data, presents it as a 
TreeModel,
 and 
voilà
:
 you have a fully 
navigable tree widget.
Now you can get fancy and start using the viewer classes; you can change how nodes are rendered, 
and use special icons, fonts, or colors. When the VP comes back and says the new corporate 
standards dictate the use of a Skull and Crossbones icon for certain employees, you can make the 
changes to 
TreeCellRenderer
 without touching any other code.
 Beyond GUIs
While MVC is typically taught in the context of GUI development, it is really a general-purpos
e
programming technique. The view is an interpretation of the model (perhaps a subset)—it doesn'
t
need to be graphical. The controller is more of a coordination mechanism, and doesn't have to b
e
related to any sort of input device
.
Model. 
 
 The abstract data model representing the target object. The model has no direc
t
knowledge of any views or controllers.
View. 
 
 A way to interpret the model. It subscribes to changes in the model and logical event
s
from the controller.
Controller. 
 
 A way to control the view and provide the model with new data. It publishe
s
events to both the model and the view.
Let's look at a nongraphical example.
Baseball is a unique institution. Where else can you learn such gems of trivia as ""this has become the 
highest-scoring game played on a Tuesday, in the rain, under artificial lights, between teams whose 
names start with a vowel?"" Suppose we were charged with developing software to support those 
intrepid announcers who must dutifully report on the scores, the statistics, and the trivia.
Clearly we need information on the game in progress—the teams playing, the conditions, the player a
t
bat, the score, and so on. These facts form our models; they will be updated as new informatio
n
arrives (a pitcher is changed, a player strikes out, it starts raining…)
.
We'll then have a number of view objects that use these models. One view might look for runs so it 
can update the current score. Another may receive notifications of new batters, and retrieve a brief 
summary of their year-to-date statistics. A third viewer may look at the data and check for new world 
records. We might even have a trivia viewer, responsible for coming up with those weird and useless 
facts that thrill the viewing public.
But we don't want to flood the poor announcer with all of these views directly. Instead, we'll have each 
view generate notifications of ""interesting"" events, and let some higher-level object schedule what gets 
shown.
[9]
[9]
 The fact that a plane flies overhead probably isn't interesting unless it's the 100th plane to fly overhea
d
that night.
These viewer objects have suddenly become models for the higher-level object, which itself might 
then be a model for different formatting viewers. One formatting viewer might create the teleprompter 
script for the announcer, another might generate video captions directly on the satellite uplink, another 
might update the network's or team's Web pages (see 
Figure 5.5
).
 Figure 5.5. Baseball reporting, Viewers subscribe to models.
This kind of model-viewer network is a common (and valuable) design technique. Each link decouple
s
raw data from the events that created it—each new viewer is an abstraction. And because th
e
relationships are a network (not just a linear chain), we have a lot of flexibility. Each model may hav
e
many
 viewers, and one viewer may work with multiple models.
In advanced systems such as this one, it can be handy to have 
debugging views

Still Coupled (After All These Years)
Despite the decrease in coupling we have achieved, listeners and event generators (subscribers and 
publishers) still have 
some
 knowledge of each other. In Java, for instance, they must agree on 
common interface definitions and calling conventions.
In the next section, we'll look at ways of reducing coupling even further by using a form of publish and 
subscribe where 
none
 of the participants need know about each other, or call each other directly.

Suppose you have an airline reservation system that includes the concept of a flight
:
                                                               
 
     
public interface
 Flight {
       // 
Return false if flight full.
 
      public boolean
 addPassenger(Passenger p);
 
      public void
 addToWaitList(Passenger p);
 
      public int
 getFlightCapacity();
 
      public int
 getNumPassengers();
     }
If you add a passenger to the wait list, they'll be put on the flight automatically when an 
opening becomes available.
There's a massive reporting job that goes through looking for overbooked or full flights to 
suggest when additional flights might be scheduled. It works fine, but it takes hours to 
run.
We'd like to have a little more flexibility in processing wait-list passengers, and we've go
t
to do something about that big report—it takes too long to run. Use the ideas from thi
s
section to redesign this interface

Blackboards
The writing is on the wall
…
You may not usually associate 
elegance
 with police detectives, picturing instead some sort of 
doughnut and coffee cliché. But consider how detectives might use a
 
blackboard
 to coordinate and 
solve a murder investigation.
Suppose the chief inspector starts off by setting up a large blackboard in the conference room. On it, 
he writes a single question:
H. D
UMPTY
 (M
ALE
, E
GG
): A
CCIDENT OR MURDER
?
Did Humpty really fall, or was he pushed? Each detective may make contributions to this potential 
murder mystery by adding facts, statements from witnesses, any forensic evidence that might arise, 
and so on. As the data accumulates, a detective might notice a connection and post that observation 
or speculation as well. This process continues, across all shifts, with many different people and 
agents, until the case is closed. A sample blackboard is shown in 
Figure 5.6
 on the next page.
Figure 5.6. Someone found a connection between Humpty's gambling debts and the phone logs. Perhaps he 
was getting threatening phone calls.
Some key features of the blackboard approach are:
None of the detectives needs to know of the existence of any other detective—they watch th
e
board for new information, and add their findings
.
The detectives may be trained in different disciplines, may have different levels of education 
and expertise, and may not even work in the same precinct. They share a desire to solve the 
case, but that's all.
Different detectives may come and go during the course of the process, and may work 
different shifts.
 There are no restrictions on what may be placed on the blackboard. It may be pictures, 
sentences, physical evidence, and so on.
We've worked on a number of projects that involved a workflow or distributed data gathering process. 
With each, designing a solution around a simple blackboard model gave us a solid metaphor to work 
with: all of the features listed above using detectives are just as applicable to objects and code 
modules.
A blackboard system lets us decouple our objects from each other completely, providing a forum 
where knowledge consumers and producers can exchange data anonymously and asynchronously. 
As you might guess, it also cuts down on the amount of code we have to write.
Blackboard Implementations
Computer-based blackboard systems were originally invented for use in artificial intelligenc
e
applications where the problems to be solved were large and complex—speech recognition
,
knowledge-based reasoning systems, and so on
.
Modern distributed blackboard-like systems such as JavaSpaces and T Spaces [
URL 50
, 
URL 25
] are 
based on a model of key/value pairs first popularized in Linda [
CG90
], where the concept was known 
as 
tuple space.
With these systems, you can store active Java objects—not just data—on the blackboard, and retriev
e
them by partial matching of fields (via templates and wildcards) or by subtypes. For example, suppos
e
you had a type
 
Author,
 which is a subtype of 
Person.
 You could search a blackboard containing 
Person
 objects by using an 
Author
 template with a 
lastName
 value of ""Shakespeare."" You'd get Bill 
Shakespeare the author, but not Fred Shakespeare the gardener.
The main operations in JavaSpaces are:
Name
Function
read
Search for and retrieve data from the space.
write
Put an item into the space.
take
Similar to read, but removes the item from the space as well.
notify
Set up a notification to occur whenever an object is written that matches the template.
T Spaces supports a similar set of operations, but with different names and slightly different semantics. 
Both systems are built like a database product; they provide atomic operations and distributed 
transactions to ensure data integrity.
Since we can store objects, we can use a blackboard to design algorithms based on a 
flow of objects,
not just data. It's as if our detectives could pin people to the blackboard—witnesses themselves, no
t
just their statements. Anyone can ask a witness questions in the pursuit of the case, post th
e
transcript, and move that witness to another area of the blackboard, where he might respon
d
differently (if you allow the witness to read the blackboard too)
.
 A big advantage of systems such as these is that you have a single, consistent interface to the 
blackboard. When building a conventional distributed application, you can spend a great deal of time 
crafting unique API calls for every distributed transaction and interaction in the system. With the 
combinatorial explosion of interfaces and interactions, the project can quickly become a nightmare.
Organizing Your Blackboard
When the detectives work on large cases, the blackboard may be- come 
cluttered, and it may become difficult to locate data on the board. The solution is 
to 
partition
 the blackboard and start to organize the data on the blackboard 
somehow.
Different software systems handle this partitioning in different ways; some use 
fairly flat 
zones
 or 
interests groups,
 while others adopt a more hierarchical 
treelike structure.
The blackboard style of programming removes the need for so many interfaces, making for a more

"The blackboard style of programming removes the need for so many interfaces, making for a more 
elegant and consistent system.
Application Example
Suppose we are writing a program to accept and process mortgage or loan applications. The laws tha
t
govern this area are odiously complex, with federal, state, and local governments all having their say
.
The lender must prove they have disclosed certain things, and must ask for certain information—bu
t
must
 
not
 ask certain other questions, and so on, and so on.
Beyond the miasma of applicable law, we also have the following problems to contend with.
There is no guarantee on the order in which data arrives. For instance, queries for a credit 
check or title search may take a substantial amount of time, while items such as name and 
address may be available immediately.
Data gathering may be done by different people, distributed across different offices, in 
different time zones.
Some data gathering may be done automatically by other systems. This data may arrive 
asynchronously as well.
Nonetheless, certain data may still be dependent on other data. For instance, you may not be 
able to start the title search for a car until you get proof of ownership or insurance.
Arrival of new data may raise new questions and policies. Suppose the credit check comes 
back with a less than glowing report; now you need these five extra forms and perhaps a 
 blood sample.
You can try to handle every possible combination and circumstance using a workflow system. Many 
such systems exist, but they can be complex and programmer intensive. As regulations change, the 
work-flow must be reorganized: people may have to change their procedures and hard-wired code 
may have to be rewritten.
A blackboard, in combination with a rules engine that encapsulates the legal requirements, is an 
elegant solution to the difficulties found here. Order of data arrival is irrelevant: when a fact is posted it 
can trigger the appropriate rules. Feedback is easily handled as well: the output of any set of rules can 
post to the blackboard and cause the triggering of yet more applicable rules.
Tip 43
Use Blackboards to Coordinate Workflow
We can use the blackboard to coordinate disparate facts and agents, while still maintaining 
independence and even isolation among participants.
You can accomplish the same results with more brute-force methods, of course, but you'll have a 
more brittle system. When it breaks, all the king's horses and all the king's men might not get your 
program working again.

transcribing the design into executable statements. We think that this attitude is the single biggest 
reason that many programs are ugly, inefficient, poorly structured, unmaintainable, and just plain 
wrong.
Coding is not mechanical. If it were, all the CASE tools that people pinned their hopes on in the earl
y
1980s would have replaced programmers long ago. There are decisions to be made ever
y
minute—decisions that require careful thought and judgment if the resulting program is to enjoy a long
,
accurate, and productive life
.
Developers who don't actively think about their code are programming by coincidence—the cod
e
might work, but there's no particular reason why. In
 
Programming by Coincidence,
 we advocate a 
more positive involvement with the coding process.
While most of the code we write executes quickly, we occasionally develop algorithms that have the 
potential to bog down even the fastest processors. In 
Algorithm Speed,
 we discuss ways to estimate 
the speed of code, and we give some tips on how to spot potential problems before they happen.
Pragmatic Programmers think critically about all code, including our own. We constantly see room for 
improvement in our programs and our designs. In 
Refactoring,
 we look at techniques that help us fix 
up existing code even while we're in the midst of a project.
Something that should be in the back of your mind whenever you're producing code is that you'll 
someday have to test it. Make code easy to test, and you'll increase the likelihood that it will actually 
get tested, a thought we develop in 
Code That's Easy to Test.
Finally, in 
Evil Wizards,
 we suggest that you should be careful of tools that write reams of code on 
your behalf unless you understand what they're doing.
Most of us can drive a car largely on autopilot—we don't explicitly command our foot to press a pedal
,
or our arm to turn the wheel—we just think ""slow down and turn right."" However, good, safe drivers ar
e
constantly reviewing the situation, checking for potential problems, and putting themselves into goo
d
positions in case the unexpected happens. The same is true of coding—it may be largely routine, bu
t
keeping your wits about you could well prevent a disaster

Programming by Coincidence
Do you ever watch old black-and-white war movies? The weary soldier advances cautiously out of th
e
brush. There's a clearing ahead: are there any land mines, or is it safe to cross? There aren't an
y
indications that it's a minefield—no signs, barbed wire, or craters. The soldier pokes the ground ahea
d
of him with his bayonet and winces, expecting an explosion. There isn't one. So he proceed
s
painstakingly through the field for a while, prodding and poking as he goes. Eventually, convinced tha
t
the field is safe, he straightens up and marches proudly forward, only to be blown to pieces
.
The soldier's initial probes for mines revealed nothing, but this was merely lucky. He was led to a fals
e
conclusion—with disastrous results
.
As developers, we also work in minefields. There are hundreds of traps just waiting to catch us eac
h
day. Remembering the soldier's tale, we should be wary of drawing false conclusions. We shoul

"ing the soldier's tale, we should be wary of drawing false conclusions. We shoul
d
avoid programming by coincidence—relying on luck and accidental successes— in favor o
f
programming deliberately.
How to Program by Coincidence
Suppose Fred is given a programming assignment. Fred types in some code, tries it, and it seems to 
work. Fred types in some more code, tries it, and it still seems to work. After several weeks of coding 
this way, the program suddenly stops working, and after hours of trying to fix it, he still doesn't know 
why. Fred may well spend a significant amount of time chasing this piece of code around without ever 
being able to fix it. No matter what he does, it just doesn't ever seem to work right.
Fred doesn't know why the code is failing because 
he didn't know why it worked in the first place.
 It 
seemed to work, given the limited ""testing"" that Fred did, but that was just a coincidence. Buoyed by 
false confidence, Fred charged ahead into oblivion. Now, most intelligent people may know someone 
like Fred, but 
we
 know better. We don't rely on coincidences—do we
?
Sometimes we might. Sometimes it can be pretty easy to confuse a happy coincidence with a 
purposeful plan. Let's look at a few examples.
Accidents of Implementation
Accidents of implementation are things that happen simply because that's the way the code is 
currently written. You end up relying on undocumented error or boundary conditions.
Suppose you call a routine with bad data. The routine responds in a particular way, and you cod
e
based on that response. But the author didn't intend for the routine to work that way—it was neve
r
even considered. When the routine gets ""fixed,"" your code may break. In the most extreme case, th
e
routine you called may not even be designed to do what you want, but it
 
seems
 to work okay. Calling 
things in the wrong order, or in the wrong context, is a related problem.
                                               
 
       paint(g);
      invalidate();
      validate();
      revalidate();
      repaint();
      paintImmediately(r);
Here it looks like Fred is desperately trying to get something out on the screen. But these routines 
were never designed to be called this way; although they seem to work, that's really just a coincidence.
To add insult to injury, when the component finally does get drawn, Fred won't try to go back and tak
e
out the spurious calls. ""It works now, better leave well enough alone….
""
It's easy to be fooled by this line of thought. Why should you take the risk of messing with something 
that's working? Well, we can think of several reasons:
It may not really be working—it might just look like it is
.
The boundary condition you rely on may be just an accident. In different circumstances (a 
different screen resolution, perhaps), it might behave differently.
Undocumented behavior may change with the next release of the library.
Additional and unnecessary calls make your code slower.
Additional calls also increase the risk of introducing new bugs of their own.
For code you write that others will call, the basic principles of good modularization and of hiding 
implementation behind small, well-documented interfaces can all help. A well-specified contract (see 
Design by Contract
) can help eliminate misunderstandings.
For routines you call, rely only on documented behavior. If you can't, for whatever reason, then 
document your assumption well.
Accidents of Context
You can have ""accidents of context"" as well. Suppose you are writing a utility module. Just because 
you are currently coding for a GUI environment, does the module have to rely on a GUI being present? 
Are you relying on English-speaking users? Literate users? What else are you relying on that isn't 
guaranteed?
Implicit Assumptions
Coincidences can mislead at all levels—from generating requirements through to testing. Testing i
s
particularly fraught with false causalities and coincidental outcomes. It's easy to assume that
 
X
 causes 
Y,
 but as we said in 
Debugging
: don't assume it, prove it.
At all levels, people operate with many assumptions in mind—but these assumptions are rarel
y
 documented and are often in conflict between different developers. Assumptions that aren't based o
n
well-established facts are the bane of all projects
.
Tip 44
Don't Program by Coincidence
How to Program Deliberately
We want to spend less time churning out code, catch and fix errors as early in the development cycle 
as possible, and create fewer errors to begin with. It helps if we can program deliberately:
Always be aware of what you are doing. Fred let things get slowly out of hand, until he ended 
up boiled, like the frog in 
Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs
.
Don't code blindfolded. Attempting to build an application you don't fully understand, or to use 
a technology you aren't familiar with, is an invitation to be misled by coincidences.
Proceed from a plan, whether that plan is in your head, on the back of a cocktail napkin, or on 
a wall-sized printout from a CASE tool.
Rely only on reliable things. Don't depend on accidents or assumptions. If you can't tell the 
difference in particular circumstances, assume the worst.
Document your assumptions. 
Design by Contract
, can help clarify your assumptions in your 
own mind, as well as help communicate them to others.
Don't just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don't guess; actually try it. Write 
an assertion to test your assumptions (see 
Assertive Programming
). If your assertion is right, 
you have improved the documentation in your code. If you discover your assumption is wrong, 
then count yourself lucky.
Prioritize your effort. Spend time on the important aspects; more than likely, these are the 
hard parts. If you don't have fundamentals or infrastructure correct, brilliant bells and whistles 
will be irrelevant.
Don't be a slave to history. Don't let existing code dictate future code. All code can b
e
replaced if it is no longer appropriate. Even within one program, don't let what you've alread
y
done constrain what you do next—be ready to refactor (see
 
Refactoring
). This decision may 
impact the project schedule. The assumption is that the impact will be less than the cost of 
not
 making the change.

 You can also go too far here. We once knew a developer who rewrote all source he wa
s
given because he had his own naming conventions.
 So next time something seems to work, but you don't know why, make sure it isn't just a coincidence.

Algorithm Speed
In 
Estimating,
 we talked about estimating things such as how long it takes to walk across town, or ho
w
long a project will take to finish. However, there is another kind of estimating that Pragmati
c
Programmers use almost daily: estimating the resources that algorithms use—time, processor
,
memory, and so on
.
This kind of estimating is often crucial. Given a choice between two ways of doing something, which 
do you pick? You know how long your program runs with 1,000 records, but how will it scale to 
1,000,000? What parts of the code need optimizing?
It turns out that these questions can often be answered using common sense, some analysis, and a 
way of writing approximations called the ""big O"" notation.
What Do We Mean by Estimating Algorithms?
Most nontrivial algorithms handle some kind of variable input—sorting
 
n
 strings, inverting an 
m × 
n
matrix, or decrypting a message with an 
n
-bit key. Normally, the size of this input will affect the 
algorithm: the larger the input, the longer the running time or the more memory used.
If the relationship were always linear (so that the time increased in direct proportion to the value of 
n
), 
this section wouldn't be important. However, most significant algorithms are not linear. The good news 
is that many are sublinear. A binary search, for example, doesn't need to look at every candidate when 
finding a match. The bad news is that other algorithms are considerably worse than linear; runtimes or 
memory requirements increase far faster than 
n.
 An algorithm that takes a minute to process ten items 
may take a lifetime to process 100.
We find that whenever we write anything containing loops or recursive calls, we subconsciously check 
the runtime and memory requirements. This is rarely a formal process, but rather a quick confirmation 
that what we're doing is sensible in the circumstances. However, we sometimes 
do
 find ourselves 
performing a more detailed analysis. That's when the 
O
() notation comes in useful.
The O() Notation
The 
O
() notation is a mathematical way of dealing with approximations. When we write that a 
particular sort routine sorts 
n
 records in 
O
(
n
2
) time, we are simply saying that the worst-case time 
taken will vary as the square of 
n.
 Double the number of records, and the time will increase roughly 
fourfold. Think of the 
O
 as meaning 
on the order of.
 The 
O
() notation puts an upper bound on the value 
of the thing we're measuring (time, memory, and so on). If we say a function takes 
O
(
n
2
) time, then we
know that the upper bound of the time it takes will not grow faster than 
n
2
. Sometimes we come up 
with fairly complex 
O
() functions, but because the highest-order term will dominate the value as 
n
increases, the convention is to remove all low-order terms, and not to bother showing any constant 
multiplying factors. 
O
(
n
2
/2
+
 3
n
) is the same as 
O
(
n
2
/2), which is equivalent to 
O
(
n
2
). This is actually a 
 weakness of the 
O
() notation—one
 
O
(
n
2
) algorithm may be 1,000 times faster than another 
O
(
n
2
) 
algorithm, but you won't know it from the notation.
Figure 6.1
 shows several common 
O
() notations you'll come across, along with a graph comparing 
running times of algorithms in each category. Clearly, things quickly start getting out of hand once we 
get over
O
(
n
2
).
Figure 6.1. Runtimes of various algorithms
 For example, suppose you've got a routine that takes 1 s to process 100 records. How long will it take 
to process 1,000? If your code is 
O
(1), then it will still take 1 s. If it's 
O
(lg(
n
)), then you'll probably be 
waiting about 3 s. 
O
(
n
) will show a linear increase to 10 s, while an 
O
(
n
 lg(
n
)) will take some 33 s. If 
you're unlucky enough to have an 
O
(
n
2
) routine, then sit back for 100 s while it does its stuff. And if 
you're using an exponential algorithm 
O
(2
n
), you might want to make a cup of coffee—your routin
e
 should finish in about 1
0
263
 years. Let us know how the universe ends.
The 
O
() notation doesn't apply just to time; you can use it to represent any other resources used by an 
algorithm. For example, it is often useful to be able to model memory consumption (see Exercise 35).
Common Sense Estimation
You can estimate the order of many basic algorithms using common sense.
Simple loops. 
 
 If a simple loop runs from 1 to
 
n,
 then the algorithm is likely to be 
O
(
n
)
—
time 
increases linearly with 
n.
 Examples include exhaustive searches, finding the maximum value 
in an array, and generating checksums.
Nested loops. 
 
 If you nest a loop inside another, then your algorithm becomes
 
O
(
m × 
n
)
,
where 
m
 and 
n
 are the two loops' limits. This commonly occurs in simple sorting algorithms, 
such as bubble sort, where the outer loop scans each element in the array in turn, and the 
inner loop works out where to place that element in the sorted result. Such sorting algorithms 
tend to be 
O
(
n
2
).
Binary chop.

" be 
O
(
n
2
).
Binary chop. 
 
 If your algorithm halves the set of things it considers each time around th
e
loop, then it is likely to be logarithmic, 
O
(lg(
n
)) (see Exercise 37). A binary search of a sorted 
list, traversing a binary tree, and finding the first set bit in a machine word can all be 
O
(lg(
n
)).
Divide and conquer. 
 
 Algorithms that partition their input, work on the two halve
s
independently, and then combine the result can be 
O
(
n
 lg(
n
)). The classic example is 
quicksort, which works by partitioning the data into two halves and recursively sorting each. 
Although technically 
O

n
2
)
,
 because its behavior degrades when it is fed sorted input, the 
average runtime of quicksort is 
O
(
n
 lg(

Combinatoric. 
 
 Whenever algorithms start looking at the permutations of things, thei

running times may get out of hand. This is because permutations involve factorials (there are 
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 permutations of the digits from 1 to 5). Time a combinatori

the running times of these types of algorithms in particular problem domains
.
Algorithm Speed in Practice
It's unlikely that you'll spend much time during your career writing sort routines. The ones in the 
libraries available to you will probably outperform anything you may write without substantial effort. 
However, the basic kinds of algorithms we've described earlier pop up time and time again. Whenever
you find yourself writing a simple loop, you know that you have an 
O
(
n
) algorithm. If that loop contains 
an inner loop, then you're looking at 
O
(
m × 
n
)
.
 You should be asking yourself how large these values 
can get. If the numbers are bounded, then you'll know how long the code will take to run. If the 
 numbers depend on external factors (such as the number of records in an overnight batch run, or the 
number of names in a list of people), then you might want to stop and consider the effect that large 
values may have on your running time or memory consumption.
Tip 45
Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms
There are some approaches you can take to address potential problems. If you have an algorithm that 
is 
O
(
n
2
)
,
 try to find a divide and conquer approach that will take you down to 
O
(
n
 lg(
n
)).
If you're not sure how long your code will take, or how much memory it will use, try running it, varying 
the input record count or whatever is likely to impact the runtime. Then plot the results. You should 
soon get a good idea of the shape of the curve. Is it curving upward, a straight line, or flattening off as 
the input size increases? Three or four points should give you an idea.
Also consider just what you're doing in the code itself. A simple 
O
(
n
2
) loop may well perform better 
that a complex, 
O
(
n
 lg(
n
)) one for smaller values of 
n,
 particularly if the 
O
(
n
 lg(
n
)) algorithm has an 
expensive inner loop.
In the middle of all this theory, don't forget that there are practical considerations as well. Runtime may 
look like it increases linearly for small input sets. But feed the code millions of records and suddenl
y
the time degrades as the system starts to thrash. If you test a sort routine with random input keys, you 
may be surprised the first time it encounters ordered input. Pragmatic Programmers try to cover both 
the theoretical and practical bases. After all this estimating, the only timing that counts is the speed of 
your code, running in the production environment, with real data.
[2]
 This leads to our next tip
.
[2]
 In fact, while testing the sort algorithms used as an exercise for this section on a 64MB Pentium, th
e
authors ran out of real memory while running the radix sort with more than seven million numbers. The 
sort started using swap space, and times degraded dramatically.
Tip 46
Test Your Estimates
If it's tricky getting accurate timings, use 
code profilers
 to count the number of times the different steps 
in your algorithm get executed, and plot these figures against the size of the input.
Best Isn't Always Best
 You also need to be pragmatic about choosing appropriate algorithms—the fastest one is not alway
s
the best for the job. Given a small input set, a straightforward insertion sort will perform just as well a
s
a quicksort, and will take you less time to write and debug. You also need to be careful if the algorith
m
you choose has a high setup cost. For small input sets, this setup may dwarf the running time an
d
make the algorithm inappropriate
.
Also be wary of 
premature optimization.
 It's always a good idea to make sure an algorithm really is a 
bottleneck before investing your precious time trying to improve it.

Challenges
Every developer should have a feel for how algorithms are designed and analyzed. Robert 
Sedgewick has written a series of accessible books on the subject ([
Sed83
, 
SF96
, 
Sed92
] 
and others). We recommend adding one of his books to your collection, and making a point of 
reading it.
For those who like more detail than Sedgewick provides, read Donald Knuth's definitive 
Art of 
Computer Programming
 books, which analyze a wide range of algorithms [
Knu97a
, 
Knu97b
, 
Knu98
].
In Exercise 34, we look at sorting arrays of long integers. What is the impact if the keys are 
more complex, and the overhead of key comparison is high? Does the key structure affect the 
efficiency of the sort algorithms, or is the fastest sort always fastest?
Exercises
34.
We have coded a set of simple sort routines, which can be downloaded from our Web 
site (
http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com
). Run them on various machines available to 
you. Do your figures follow the expected curves? What can you deduce about the 
relative speeds of your machines? What are the effects of various compiler optimization 
settings? Is the radix sort indeed linear?

Refactoring
Change and decay in all around I see 
…
H. F. Lyte, ""Abide With Me""
As a program evolves, it will become necessary to rethink earlier decisions and rework portions of the 
code. This process is perfectly natural. Code needs to evolve; it's not a static thing.
Unfortunately, the most common metaphor for software development is building construction (Bertrand 
Meyer [
Mey97b
] uses the term ""Software Construction""). But using construction as the guiding 
metaphor implies these steps:
An architect draws up blueprints.
1
.
Contractors dig the foundation, build the superstructure, wire and plumb, and apply finishing 
touches.
2
.
The tenants move in and live happily ever after, calling building maintenance to fix any 
problems.
3
.
Well, software doesn't quite work that way. Rather than construction, software is more like 
gardening
—
it is more organic than concrete. You plant many things in a garden according to an initial 
plan and conditions. Some thrive, others are destined to end up as compost. You may move plantings 
relative to each other to take advantage of the interplay of light and shadow, wind and rain. Overgrown 
plants get split or pruned, and colors that clash may get moved to more aesthetically pleasing 
locations. You pull weeds, and you fertilize plantings that are in need of some extra help. You 
constantly monitor the health of the garden, and make adjustments (to the soil, the plants, the layout) 
as needed.
Business people are comfortable with the metaphor of building construction: it is more scientific tha
n
gardening, it's repeatable, there's a rigid reporting hierarchy for management, and so on. But we're no
t
building skyscrapers—we aren't as constrained by the boundaries of physics and the real world
.
The gardening metaphor is much closer to the realities of software development. Perhaps a certai
n
routine has grown too large, or is trying to accomplish too much—it needs to be split into two. Thing
s
that don't work out as planned need to be weeded or pruned
.
Rewriting, reworking, and re-architecting code is collectively known as 
refactoring.
When Should You Refactor?
 When you come across a stumbling block because the code doesn't quite fit anymore, or you notice 
two things that should really be merged, or anything else at all strikes you as being ""wrong,""
 
don't 
hesitate to change it
 There's no time like the present. Any number of things may cause code to qualify 
for refactoring:
Duplication. 
 
 You've discovered a violation of the
 
DRY
 principle (
The Evils of Duplication
).
Nonorthogonal design. 
 
 You've discovered some code or design that could be made mor
e
orthogonal (
Orthogonality
).
Outdated knowledge. 
 
 Things change, requirements drift, and your knowledge of th
e
problem increases. Code needs to keep up.
Performance. 
 
 You need to move functionality from one area of the system to another t
o
improve performance.
Refactoring your code—moving functionality around and updating earlier decisions—is really a
n
exercise in
 
pain management.
 Let's face it, changing source code around can be pretty painful: it was 
almost working, and now it's 
really
 torn up. Many developers are reluctant to start ripping up code just 
because it isn't quite right.
Real-World Complications
So you go to your boss or client and say, ""This code works, but I need another week to refactor it.""
We can't print their reply.
Time pressure is often used as an excuse for not refactoring. But this excuse just doesn't hold up: fai
l
to refactor now, and there'll be a far greater time investment to fix the problem down the road—whe
n
there are more dependencies to reckon with. Will there be more time available then? Not in ou
r
experience
.
You might want to explain this principle to the boss by using a medical analogy: think of the code tha
t
needs refactoring as a ""growth."" Removing it requires invasive surgery. You can go in now, and take i
t
out while it is still small. Or, you could wait while it grows and spreads—but removing it then will b
e
both more expensive and more dangerous. Wait even longer, and you may lose the patient entirely
.
Tip 47
Refactor Early, Refactor Often
 Keep track of the things that need to be refactored. If you can't refactor something immediately, make 
sure that it gets placed on the schedule. Make sure that users of the affected code 
know
 that it is 
scheduled to be refactored and how this might affect them.
How Do You Refactor?
Refactoring started out in the Smalltalk community, and, along with other trends (such as design 
patterns), has started to gain a wider audience. But as a topic it is still fairly new; there isn't much 
published on it. The first major book on refactoring ([
FBB
+
99
], and also [
URL 47
]) is being published 
around the same time as this book.
At its heart, refactoring is redesign. Anything that you or others on your team designed can be 
redesigned in light of new facts, deeper understandings, changing requirements, and so on. But if you 
proceed to rip up vast quantities of code with wild abandon, you may find yourself in a worse position 
than when you started.
Clearly, refactoring is an activity that needs to be undertaken slowly, deliberately, and carefully. Martin 
Fowler offers the following simple tips on how to refactor without doing more harm than good (see the 
box on in [
FS97
]):
Don't try to refactor and add functionality at the same time.
1
.
Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. Run the tests as often as 
possible. That way you will know quickly if your changes have broken anything.
Automatic Refactoring
Historically, Smalltalk users have always enjoyed a 
class browser
 as part 
of the IDE. Not to be confused with Web browsers, class browsers let 
users navigate through and examine class hierarchies and methods.
Typically, class browsers allow you to edit code","[0.0047191936, 0.053689577, 0.015249857, 0.018134587, 0.034000598, 0.011083803, -0.021187358, 0.0142346, -0.045847595, 0.06363209, 0.08150061,

" through and examine class hierarchies and methods.
Typically, class browsers allow you to edit code, create new methods and 
classes, and so on. The next variation on this idea is the 
refactoring 
browser.
A refactoring browser can semiautomatically perform common refactoring 
operations for you: splitting up a long routine into smaller ones, 
automatically propagating changes to method and variable names, drag 
and drop to assist you in moving code, and so on.

.
 As we write this book, this technology has yet to appear outside of th
e
Smalltalk world, but this is likely to change at the same speed that Jav
a
changes—rapidly. In the meantime, the pioneering Small-talk refactorin
g
browser can be found online at 
[
URL 20
].
Take short, deliberate steps: move a field from one class to another, fuse two similar methods 
into a superclass. Refactoring often involves making many localized changes that result in a 
larger-scale change. If you keep your steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid 
prolonged debugging.

.
We'll talk more about testing at this level in 
Code That's Easy to Test
, and larger-scale testing in 
Ruthless Testing
, but Mr. Fowler's point of maintaining good regression tests is the key to refactoring 
with confidence.
It can also be helpful to make sure that drastic changes to a module—such as altering its interface o
r
its functionality in an incompatible manner—break the build. That is, old clients of this code should fal
l
to compile. You can then quickly find the old clients and make the necessary changes to bring them u
p
to date
.
So next time you see a piece of code that isn't quite as it should be, fix both it and everything that 
depends on it. Manage the pain: if it hurts now, but is going to hurt even more later, you might as well 
get it over with. Remember the lessons of 
Software Entropy

Code That's Easy to Test
The 
Software IC
 is a metaphor that people like to toss around when discussing reusability and 
component-based development.
[3]
 The idea is that software components should be combined just a
s
integrated circuit chips are combined. This works only if the components you are using are known to 
be reliable.
[3]
 The term ""Software IC"" (Integrated Circuit) seems to have been invented in 1986 by Cox an
d
Novobilski in their Objective-C book 
Object-Oriented Programming
 [
CN91
].
Chips are designed to be tested—not just at the factory, not just when they are installed, but also i
n
the field when they are deployed. More complex chips and systems may have a full Built-in Self Tes
t
(BIST) feature that runs some base-level diagnostics internally, or a Test Access Mechanism (TAM
)
that provides a test harness that allows the external environment to provide stimuli and collec
t
responses from the chip
.
We can do the same thing in software. Like our hardware colleagues, we need to build testability into 
the software from the very beginning, and test each piece thoroughly before trying to wire them 
together.
Unit Testing
Chip-level testing for hardware is roughly equivalent to 
unit testing
 in software—testing done on eac
h
module, in isolation, to verify its behavior. We can get a better feeling for how a module will react in th
e
big wide world once we have tested it throughly under controlled (even contrived) conditions
.
A software unit test is code that exercises a module. Typically, the unit test will establish some kind of 
artificial environment, then invoke routines in the module being tested. It then checks the results that 
are returned, either against known values or against the results from previous runs of the same test 
(regression testing).
Later, when we assemble our ""software IC's"" into a complete system, we'll have confidence that the 
individual parts work as expected, and then we can use the same unit test facilities to test the system 
as a whole. We talk about this large-scale checking of the system in 
Ruthless Testing
.
Before we get that far, however, we need to decide what to test at the unit level. Typically, 
programmers throw a few random bits of data at the code and call it tested. We can do much better,","[-0.043372028, 0.0036496508, 0.018383427, 0.011142578, 0.03089234, -0.013612212, 0.008870223, 0.0038359694, -0.00014407719, 0.04606086, 0.09954523, -0.011485988, -0.027779724,

" a few random bits of data at the code and call it tested. We can do much better, 
using the ideas behind 
design by contract.
Testing Against Contract
 We like to think of unit testing as 
testing against contract
 (see 
Design by Contract
). We want to write 
test cases that ensure that a given unit honors its contract. This will tell us two things: whether the 
code meet the contract, and whether the contract means what we think it means. We want to test that 
the module delivers the functionality it promises, over a wide range of test cases and boundary 
conditions.
What does this mean in practice? Let's look at the square root routine we first encountered on page 
114. Its contract is simple:
                                       
 
    
require:
      argument >= 0;
    
ensure:
      ((result * result) - argument).abs <= epsilon*argument;
This tells us what to test:
Pass in a negative argument and ensure that it is rejected.
Pass in an argument of zero to ensure that it is accepted (this is the boundary value).
Pass in values between zero and the maximum expressible argument and verify that the 
difference between the square of the result and the original argument is less than some small 
fraction of the argument.
Armed with this contract, and assuming that our routine does its own pre- and postcondition checking, 
we can write a basic test script to exercise the square root function.
                                       
 
    
public void
 testValue(
double
 num, 
double
 expected) {
      
double
 result = 0.0;
      
try
 {                   // 
We may throw a
        result = mySqrt(num); // 
precondition exception
      }
      
catch
 (Throwable e) {
        
if
 (num < 0.0)        // 
If input is < 0, then
          
return;
            // 
we're expecting the
        
else
                 // 
exception, otherwise
          assert(
false
);      // 
force a test failure
      }
      assert(Math.abs(expected-result) < epsilon*expected);
    }
Then we can call this routine to test our square root function:
                                        
 
    testValue(-4.0,  0.0);
    testValue( 0.0,  0.0);
    testValue( 2.0,  1.4142135624);
    testValue(64.0,  8.0);
    testValue(1.0e7, 3162.2776602);
This is a pretty simple test; in the real world, any nontrivial module is likely to be dependent on a 
number of other modules, so how do we go about testing the combination?
Suppose we have a module A that uses a 
LinkedList
 and a 
Sort.
 In order, we would test:
LinkedList's
 contract, in full
1
.
Sort's
 contract, in full
2
.
A's contract, which relies on the other contracts but does not directly expose them
3
.
This style of testing requires you to test subcomponents of a module first. Once the subcomponents 
have been verified, then the module itself can be tested.
If 
LinkedList
 and 
Sort
's tests passed, but A's test failed, we can be pretty sure that the problem is in A, 
or in A's 
use
 of one of those subcomponents. This technique is a great way to reduce debugging 
effort: we can quickly concentrate on the likely source of the problem within module A, and not waste 
time reexamining its subcomponents.
Why do we go to all this trouble? Above all, we want to avoid creating a ""time bomb""—something tha
t
sits around unnoticed and blows up at an awkward moment later in the project. By emphasizing testin
g
against contract, we can try to avoid as many of those downstream disasters as possible
.
Tip 48
Design to Test
When you design a module, or even a single routine, you should design both its contract and the code 
to test that contract. By designing code to pass a test and fulfill its contract, you may well consider 
boundary conditions and other issues that wouldn't occur to you otherwise. There's no better way to fix 
errors than by avoiding them in the first place. In fact, by building the tests 
before
 you implement the 
code, you get to try out the interface before you commit to it.
Writing Unit Tests
 The unit tests for a module shouldn't be shoved in some far-away corner of the source tree. They 
need to be conveniently located. For small projects, you can embed the unit test for a module in the 
module itself. For larger projects, we suggest moving each test into a subdirectory. Either way, 
remember that if it isn't easy to find, it won't be used.
By making the test code readily accessible, you are providing developers who may use your code with 
two invaluable resources:
Examples of how to use all the functionality of your module
1
.
A means to build regression tests to validate any future changes to the code
2
.
It's convenient, but not always practical, for each class or module to contain its own unit test. In Java, 
for example, every class can have its own 
main.
 In all but the application's main class file, the 
main
routine can be used to run unit tests; it will be ignored when the application itself is run. This has the 
benefit that the code you ship still contains the tests, which can be used to diagnose problems in the 
field.
In C++ you can achieve the same effect (at compile time) by using 
#ifdef
 to compile unit test code 
selectively. For example, here's a very simple unit test in C++, embedded in our module, that checks 
our square root function using a 
testValue
 routine similar to the Java one defined previously:
                                       
 
#
ifdef
 _TEST_
    
int
 main(
int
 argc, 
char
 **argv)
    {
      argc--; argv++;       // 
skip program name
      
if
 (argc < 2) {       // 
do standard tests if no args
        testValue(-4.0,  0.0);
        testValue( 0.0,  0.0);
        testValue( 2.0,  1.4142135624);
        testValue(64.0,  8.0);
        testValue(1.0e7, 3162.2776602);
      }
      
else
 {                // 
else use args
        
double
 num, expected;
        
while
 (argc >= 2) {
          num = atof(argv[0]);
          expected = atof(argv[1]);
          testValue(num,expected);
          argc -= 2;
          argv += 2;
        }
      }
       
return
 0;
    }
    
#
endif
                                       
 
This unit test will either run a minimal set of tests or, if given arguments, allow you to pass data in from 
the outside world. A shell script could use this ability to run a much more complete set of tests.

"What do you do if the correct response for a unit test is to exit, or abort the program? In that case, you 
need to be able to select the test to run, perhaps by specifying an argument on the command line. 
You'll also need to pass in parameters if you need to specify different starting conditions for your tests.
But providing unit tests isn't enough. You must run them, and run them often. It also helps if the class 
passes
 its tests once in a while.
Using Test Harnesses
Because we usually write 
a lot
 of test code, and do a lot of testing, we'll make life easier on ourselves 
and develop a standard testing harness for the project. The 
main
 shown in the previous section is a 
very simple test harness, but usually we'll need more functionality than that.
A test harness can handle common operations such as logging status, analyzing output for expected 
results, and selecting and running the tests. Harnesses may be GUI driven, may be written in the 
same target language as the rest of the project, or may be implemented as a combination of 
makefiles
and Perl scripts. A simple test harness sis shown in the answer to Exercise 41 on page 305.
In object-oriented languages and environments, you might create a base class that provides these 
common operations. Individual tests can subclass from that and add specific test code. You could use 
a standard naming convention and reflection in Java to build a list of tests dynamically. This technique 
is a nice way of honoring the 
DRY
 principle—you don't have to maintain a list of available tests. Bu
t
before you go off and start writing your own harness, you may want to investigate Kent Beck and Eric
h
Gamma's xUnit at 
[
URL 22
]. They've already done the hard work.
Regardless of the technology you decide to use, test harnesses should include the following 
capabilities:
A standard way to specify setup and cleanup
A method for selecting individual tests or all available tests
A means of analyzing output for expected (or unexpected) results
A standardized form of failure reporting
Tests should be composable; that is, a test can be composed of subtests of subcomponents to any 
 depth. We can use this feature to test selected parts of the system or the entire system just as easily, 
using the same tools.
Ad Hoc Testing
During debugging, we may end up creating some particular tests on-the-fly. 
These may be as simple as a 
print
 statement, or a piece of code entered 
interactively in a debugging or IDE environment.
At the end of the debugging session you need to formalize the adhoc test. If the 
code broke once, it is likely to break again. Dont't just throw away the test you 
created; add it to the existing unit test.
For example, using JUnit (the Java member of the xUnit family), we might write our square root test as 
follows:
                                       
 
    
public class
 JUnitExample 
extends
 TestCase {
      
public
 JUnitExample(
final
 String name) {
        
super
(name);
      }
      
protected void
 setUp() {
        
// Load up test data...
        testData.addElement(
new
 dblPair(-4.0,0.0));
        testData.addElement(
new
 dblPair(0.0,0.0));
        testData.addElement(
new
 dblPair(64.0,8.0));
        testData.addElement(
new
 dblPair(Double.MAX_VALUE,
                                        1.3407807929942597E154));
      }
      
public void
 testMySqrt() {
        
double
 num, expected,.result = 0.0;
        Enumeration enum = testData.element();
        
while
 (enum.hasMoreElements()) {
          dblPair p = (dblPair)enum.nextElement();
          num       = p.getNum();
          expected  = p.getExpected();
          testValue(num, expected);
        }
       }
      
public static
 Test suite() {
          TestSuite suite= 
new
 Testsuit();
          suite.addTest(
new
 JUnitExample(""
testMySqrt
""));
          
return
 suite;
      }
    }
JUnit is designed to be composable: we could add as many tests as we wanted to this suite, and each 
of those tests could in turn be a suite. In addition, you have your choice of a graphical or batch 
interface to drive the tests.
Build a Test Window
Even the best sets of tests are unlikely to find all the bugs; there's something about the damp, warm 
conditions of a production environment that seems to bring them out of the woodwork.
This means you'll often need to test a piece of software once it has been deployed—with real-worl
d
data flowing though its veins. Unlike a circuit board or chip, we don't have
 
test pins
 in software, but we
can
 provide various views into the internal state of a module, without using the debugger (which may 
be inconvenient or impossible in a production application).
Log files containing trace messages are one such mechanism. Log messages should be in a regular
,
consistent format; you may want to parse them automatically to deduce processing time or logic path
s
that the program took. Poorly or inconsistently formatted diagnostics are just so much ""spew""—the
y
are difficult to read and impractical to parse
.
Another mechanism for getting inside running code is the ""hot-key"" sequence. When this particular 
combination of keys is pressed, a diagnostic control window pops up with status messages and so on. 
This isn't something you normally would reveal to end users, but it can be very handy for the help 
desk.
For larger, more complex server code, a nifty technique for providing a view into its operation is to 
include a built-in Web server. Anyone can point a Web browser to the application's HTTP port (which 
is usually on a nonstandard number, such as 8080) and see internal status, log entries, and possibly 
even some sort of a debug control panel. This may sound difficult to implement, but it's not. Freely 
available and embed-dable HTTP Web servers are available in a variety of modern languages. A good 
place to start looking is [
URL 58
].
A Culture of Testing
All software you write 
will
 be tested—if not by you and your team, then by the eventual users—so yo
u
might as well plan on testing it thoroughly. A little forethought can go a long way toward minimizin
g
 maintenance costs and help-desk calls
.
Despite its hacker reputation, the Perl community has a very strong commitment to unit and 
regression testing. The Perl standard module installation procedure supports a regression test by 
invoking
                                       
 
    % make test
There's nothing magic about Perl itself in this regard. Perl makes it easier to collate and analyze tes
t
results to ensure compliance, but the big advantage is simply that it's a standard—tests go in 
a
particular place, and have a certain expected output.
 
Testing is more cultural than technical;
 we can 
instill this testing culture in a project regardless of the language being used.

Design a test jig for the blender interface described in the answer to Exercise 17 on 
page 289. Write a shell script that will perform a regression test for the blender. You 
need to test basic functionality, error and boundary conditions, and any contractual 
obligations. What restrictions are placed on changing the speed? Are they being 
honored?

There's no denying it—applications are getting harder and harder to write. User interfaces in particula
r
are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Twenty years ago, the average application would have 
a
glass teletype interface (if it had an interface at all). Asynchronous terminals would typically provide 
a
character interactive display, while pollable devices (such as the ubiquitous IBM 3270) would let yo
u
fill in an entire screen before hitting
 
. Now, users expect graphical user interfaces, with 
context-sensitive help, cut and paste, drag and drop, OLE integration, and MDI or SDI. Users are 
looking for Web-browser integration and thin-client support.
All the time the applications themselves are getting more complex. Most developments now use a 
multitier model, possibly with some middleware layer or a transaction monitor. These programs are 
expected to be dynamic and flexible, and to interoperate with applications written by third parties.
Oh, and did we mention that we needed it all next week?
Developers are struggling to keep up. If we were using the same kind of tools that produced the basic 
dumb-terminal applications 20 years ago, we'd never get anything done.
So the tool makers and infrastructure vendors have come up with a magic bullet, the 
wizard.
 Wizard
s
are great. Do you need an MDI application with OLE container support? Just click a single button
,
answer a couple of simple questions, and the wizard will automatically generate skeleton code for you
.
The Microsoft Visual C++ environment creates over 1,200 lines of code for this scenario
,
automatically. Wizards are hard at work in other contexts, too. You can use wizards to create serve
r
components, implement Java beans, and handle network interfaces— all complex areas where it'
s
nice to have expert help
.
But using a wizard designed by a guru does not automatically make Joe developer equally expert. Jo
e
can feel pretty good—he's just produced a mass of code and a pretty spiffy-looking program. He jus
t
adds in the specific application functionality and it's ready to ship. But unless Joe actually understand
s
the code that has been produced on his behalf, he's fooling himself. He's programming b
y
coincidence. Wizards are a one-way street—they cut the code for you, and then move on. If the cod
e
they produce isn't quite right, or if circumstances change and you need to adapt the code, you're o
n
your own
.
We are not against wizards. On the contrary, we dedicate an entire section (
Code Generators
) to 
writing your own. But if you 
do
 use a wizard, and you don't understand all the code that it produces, 
you won't be in control of your own application. You won't be able to maintain it, and you'll be 
struggling when it conies time to debug.
Tip 50
Don't Use Wizard Code You Don't Understand
 Some people feel that this is an extreme position. They say that developers routinely rely on thing
s
they don't fully understand—the quantum mechanics of integrated circuits, the interrupt structure of th
e
processor, the algorithms used to schedule processes, the code in the supplied libraries, and so on
.
We agree. And we'd feel the same about wizards if they were simply a set of library calls or standar
d
operating system services that developers could rely on. But they're not. Wizards generate code tha
t
becomes an integral part of Joe's application. The wizard code is not factored out behind a tid
y
interface—it is interwoven line by line with functionality that Joe writes
.
[4]
 Eventually, it stops being th
e
wizard's code and starts being Joe's. And no one should be producing code they don't fully 
understand.
[4]
 However, there are other techniques that help manage complexity. We discuss two, beans and AOP

Challenges
If you have a GUI-building wizard available, use it to generate a skeleton application. Go 
through every line of code it produces. Do you understand it all? Could you have produced it 
yourself? Would you have produced it yourself, or is it doing things you don't need?

Chapter 7. Before the Projec
t
Do you ever get the feeling that your project is doomed, even before it starts? Sometimes it might be, 
unless you establish some basic ground rules first. Otherwise, you might as well suggest that it be 
shut down now, and save the sponsor some money.
At the very beginning of a project, you'll need to determine the requirements. Simply listening to users 
is not enough: read 
The Requirements Pit
 to find out more.
Conventional wisdom and constraint management are the topics of 
Solving Impossible Puzzles.
Whether you are performing requirements, analysis, coding, or testing, difficult problems will crop up. 
Most of the time, they won't be as difficult as they first appear to be.
When you think you've got the problems solved, you may still not feel comfortable with jumping in and 
starting. Is it simple procrastination, or is it something more? 
Not Until You're Ready
 offers advice on 
when it may be prudent to listen to that cautionary voice inside your head.
Starting too soon is one problem, but waiting too long may be even worse. In 
The Specification Trap,
we'll discuss the advantages of specification by example.
Finally, we'll look at some of the pitfalls of formal development processes and methodologies in 
Circles 
and Arrows.
 No matter how well thought out it is, and regardless of which ""best practices"" it includes, 
no method can replace 
thinking.
With these critical issues sorted out 
before
 the project gets under way, you can be better positioned to 
avoid ""analysis paralysis"" and actually begin your successful project.

" early phase of the project. The wor
d
""gathering"" seems to imply a tribe of happy analysts, foraging for nuggets of wisdom that are lying o
n
the ground all around them while the Pastoral Symphony plays gently in the background. ""Gathering
""
implies that the requirements are already there—you need merely find them, place them in you
r
basket, and be merrily on your way
.
It doesn't quite work that way. Requirements rarely lie on the surface. Normally, they're buried deep 
beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.
Tip 51
Don't Gather Requirements—Dig for The
m
Digging for Requirements
How can you recognize a true requirement while you're digging through all the surrounding dirt? The 
answer is both simple and complex.
The simple answer is that a requirement is a statement of something that needs to be accomplished. 
Good requirements might include the following:
An employee record may be viewed only by a nominated group of people.
The cylinder-head temperature must not exceed the critical value, which varies by engine.
The editor will highlight keywords, which will be selected depending on the type of file being 
edited.
However, very few requirements are as clear-cut, and that's what makes requirements analysis 
complex.
 The first statement in the list above may have been stated by the users as ""Only an employee's 
supervisors and the personnel department may view that employee's records."" Is this statement truly a 
requirement? Perhaps today, but it embeds business policy in an absolute statement. Policies change 
regularly, so we probably don't want to hardwire them into our requirements. Our recommendation is 
to document these policies separately from the requirement, and hyperlink the two. Make the 
requirement the general statement, and give the developers the policy information as an example of 
the type of thing they'll need to support in the implementation. Eventually, policy may end up as 
metadata in the application.
This is a relatively subtle distinction, but it's one that will have profound implications for the developers. 
If the requirement is stated as ""Only personnel can view an employee record,"" the developer may end 
up coding an explicit test every time the application accesses these files. However, if the statement is 
""Only authorized users may access an employee record,"" the developer will probably design and 
implement some kind of access control system. When policy changes (and it will), only the metadata 
for that system will need to be updated. In fact, gathering requirements in this way naturally leads you 
to a system that is well factored to support metadata.
The distinctions among requirements, policy, and implementation can get very blurred when user 
interfaces are discussed. ""The system must let you choose a loan term"" is a statement of requirement. 
""We need a list box to select the loan term"" may or may not be. If the users absolutely must have a list 
box, then it is a requirement. If instead they are describing the ability to choose, but are using 
listbox
as an example, then it may not be. The box on page 205 discusses a project that went horribly wrong 
because the users' interface needs were ignored.
It's important to discover the underlying reason 
why
 users do a particular thing, rather than just 
the 
way
 they currently do it. At the end of the day, your development has to solve their 
business problem,
not just meet their stated requirements. Documenting the reasons behind requirements will give your 
team invaluable information when making daily implementation decisions.
There's a simple technique for getting inside your users' requirements that isn't used often enough: 
become a user. Are you writing a system for the help desk? Spend a couple of days monitoring the 
phones with an experienced support person. Are you automating a manual stock control system? 
Work in the warehouse for a week.
[1]
 As well as giving you insight into how the system will
 
really
 be 
used, you'd be amazed at how the request ""May I sit in for a week while you do your job?"" helps build 
trust and establishes a basis for communication with your users. Just remember not to get in the way!
[1]
 Does a week sound like a long time? It really isn't, particularly when you're looking at processes i
n
which management and workers occupy different worlds. Management will give you one view of ho
w
things operate, but when you get down on the floor, you'll find a very different reality—one that will tak
e
time to assimilate
.
Tip 52
Work with a User to Think Like a User
 The requirements mining process is also the time to start to build a rapport with your user base, 
learning their expectations and hopes for the system you are building. See 
Great Expectations
, for 
more.
Documenting Requirements
So you are sitting down with the users and prying genuine requirements from them. You come acros
s
a few likely scenarios that describe what the application needs to do. Ever the professional, you wan
t
to write these down and publish a document that everyone can use as a basis for discussions—th
e
developers, the end users, and the project sponsors
.
That's a pretty wide audience.
Ivar Jacobson [
Jac94
] proposed the concept of 
use cases
 to capture requirements. They let you 
describe a particular 
use
 of the system— not in terms of user interface, but in a more abstract fashion
.
Unfortunately, Jacobson's book was a little vague on details, so there are now many different opinion
s
on what a use case should be. Is it formal or informal, simple prose or a structured document (like 
a
form)? What level of detail is appropriate (remember we have a wide audience)
?
Sometimes the Interface Is the System
In an article in 
Wired
 magazine (January 1999, page 176), producer an
d
musician Brian Eno described an incredible piece of technology—the ultimat
e
mixing board. It does anything to sound that can be done. And yet, instead o
f
letting musicians make better music, or produce a recording faster or les
s
expensively, it gets in the way; it disrupts the creative process
.
To see why, you have to look at how recording engineers work. They balanc
e
sounds intuitively. Over the years, they develop an innate feedback loo
p
between their fingertips—sliding faders, rotating knobs, and so on However, th
e
interface to the new mixer didn't leverage off those abilities. Instead, it forced it
s
users to type on a keyboard or click a mouse. The functions it provided wer
e
comprehensive, but they were packaged in unfamiliar and exotic ways. Th
e
functions the engineers needed were sometimes hidden behind obscure names
,
or were achieved with nonintuitive combinations of basic facilities
.
That environment has a requirement to leverage existing skill sets. While 
 slavishly duplicating what already exists doesn't allow for progress, we must be 
able to provide a 
transition
 to the future.
For example, the recording engineers may have been better served by som

" example, the recording engineers may have been better served by som

This example also illustrates our belief that successful tools adapt to the hands 
that use them. In this case, it is the tools that you build for others that must be 
adaptable.
One way of looking at use cases is to emphasize their goal-driven nature. Alistair Cockburn has a 
paper that describes this approach, as well as templates that can be used (strictly or not) as a starting 
place ([
Coc97a
], also online at [
URL 46
]). 
Figure 7.1
 on the following page shows an abbreviated 
example of his template, while 
Figure 7.2
 shows his sample use case.
Figure 7.1. Cockburn's use case template
 Figure 7.2. A sample use case
 By using a formal template as an 
aide-mémoire
,
 you can be sure that you include all the information 
you need in a use case: performance characteristics, other involved parties, priority, frequency, and 
various errors and exceptions that can crop up (""nonfunctional requirements""). This is also a great 
place to record user comments such as ""oh, except if we get a 
xxx
 condition, then we have to do 
yyy
instead."" The template also serves as a ready-made agenda for meetings with your users.
 This sort of organization supports the hierarchical structuring of use cases—nesting more detailed us
e
cases inside higher-level ones. For example,
 
post debit
 and 
post credit
 both elaborate on 
post 
transaction.
Use Case Diagrams
Workflow can be captured with UML activity diagrams, and conceptual-level class diagrams can 
sometimes be useful for modeling the business at hand. But true use cases are textual descriptions, 
with a hierarchy and cross-links. Use cases can contain hyperlinks to other use cases, and they can 
be nested within each other.
It seems incredible to us that anyone would seriously consider documenting information this dense 
using only simplistic stick people such as 
Figure 7.3
. Don't be a slave to any notation; use whatever 
method best communicates the requirements with your audience.

Overspecifying
A big danger in producing a requirements document is being too specific. Good requirement
s
documents remain abstract. Where requirements are concerned, the simplest statement tha
t
accurately reflects the business need is best. This doesn't mean you can be vague—you must captur
e
the underlying semantic invariants as requirements, and document the specific or current wor
k
practices as policy
.
Requirements are not architecture. Requirements are not design, nor are they the user interface. 
Requirements are 
need.
Seeing Further
The Year 2000 problem is often blamed on short-sighted programmers, desperate to save a few bytes 
in the days when mainframes had less memory than a modern TV remote control.
But it wasn't the programmers' doing, and it wasn't really a memory usage issue. If anything, it was the 
system analysts' and designers' fault. The Y2K problem came about from two main causes: a failure to 
see beyond current business practice, and a violation of the 
DRY
 principle.
 Businesses were using the two-digit shortcut long before computers came on the scene. It was 
common practice. The earliest data processing applications merely automated existing business 
processes, and simply repeated the mistake. Even if the architecture required two-digit years for data 
input, reporting, and storage, there should have been an abstraction of a 
DATE
 that ""knew"" the two 
digits were an abbreviated form of the real date.
Tip 53
Abstractions Live Longer than Details
Does ""seeing further"" require you to predict the future? No. It means generating statements such as
The system makes active use of an abstraction of DATEs. The system will implement 
DATE services, such as formatting, storage, and math operations, consistently and 
universally.
The requirements will specify only that dates are used. It may hint that some math may be done on 
dates. It may tell you that dates will be stored on various forms of secondary storage. These are 
genuine requirements for a 
DATE
 module or class.
Just One More Wafer-Thin Mint
…
Many projects failures are blamed on an increase in scope—also known as feature bloat, creepin
g
featurism, or requirements creep. This is an aspect of the boiled-frog syndrome from
 
Stone Soup and 
Boiled Frogs
. What can we do to prevent requirements from creeping up on us?
In the literature, you will find descriptions of many metrics, such as bugs reported and fixed, defect 
density, cohesion, coupling, function points, lines of code, and so on. These metrics may be tracked 
by hand or with software.
Unfortunately, not many projects seem to track requirements actively. This means that they have n
o
way to report on changes of scope—who requested a feature, who approved it, total number o
f
requests approved, and so on
.
The key to managing growth of requirements is to point out each new feature's impact on the schedule 
to the project sponsors. When the project is a year late from initial estimates and accusations start 
flying, it can be helpful to have an accurate, complete picture of how, and when, requirements growth 
occurred.
It's easy to get sucked into the ""just one more feature"" maelstrom, but by tracking requirements you 
can get a clearer picture that ""just one more feature"" is really the fifteenth new feature added this 
 month.
Maintain a Glossary
As soon as you start discussing requirements, users and domain experts will use certain terms that 
have specific meaning to them. They may differentiate between a ""client"" and a ""customer,"" for 
example. It would then be inappropriate to use either word casually in the system.
Create and maintain a 
project glossary
—one place that defines all the specific terms and vocabular
y
used in a project. All participants in the project, from end users to support staff, should use th
e
glossary to ensure consistency. This implies that the glossary needs to be widely accessible—a goo
d
argument for Web-based documentation (more on that in a moment)
.
Tip 54
Use a Project Glossary
It's very hard to succeed on a project where the users and developers refer to the same thing by 
different names or, even worse, refer to different things by the same name.
Get the Word Out
In 
It's All Writing
, we discuss publishing of project documents to internal Web sites for easy access by 
all participants. This method of distribution is particularly useful for requirements documents.
By presenting requirements as a hypertext document, we can better address the needs of a divers
e
audience—we can give each reader what they want.

Solving Impossible Puzzles
Gordius, the King of Phrygia, once tied a knot that no one could untie. It was said that he who solve
d
the riddle of the Gordian Knot would rule all of Asia. So along comes Alexander the Great, who chop
s
the knot to bits with his sword. Just a little different interpretation of the requirements, that's all… an
d
he did end up ruling most of Asia
.
Every now and again, you will find yourself embroiled in the middle of a project when a really tough 
puzzle comes up: some piece of engineering that you just can't get a handle on, or perhaps some bit 
of code that is turning out to be much harder to write than you thought. Maybe it looks impossible. But 
is it really as hard as it seems?
Consider real-world puzzles—those devious little bits of wood, wrought iron, or plastic that seem t
o
turn up as Christmas presents or at garage sales. All you have to do is remove the ring, or fit th
e
T-shaped pieces in the box, or whatever
.
So you pull on the ring, or try to put the T's in the box, and quickly discover that the obvious solution
s
just don't work. The puzzle can't be solved that way. But even though it's obvious, that doesn't sto
p
people from trying the same thing—over and over—thinking there must be a way
.
Of course, there isn't. The solution lies elsewhere. The secret to solving the puzzle is to identify the 
real (not imagined) constraints, and find a solution therein. Some constraints are 
absolute;
 others are 
merely 
preconceived notions.
 Absolute constraints 
must
 be honored, however distasteful or stupid 
they may appear to be. On the other hand, some apparent constraints may not be real constraints at 
all. For example, there's that old bar trick where you take a brand new, unopened champagne bottle 
and bet that you can drink beer out of it. The trick is to turn the bottle upside down, and pour a small 
quantity of beer in the hollow in the bottom of the bottle. Many software problems can be just as 
sneaky.
Degrees of Freedom
The popular buzz-phrase ""thinking outside the box"" encourages us to recognize constraints that might 
not be applicable and to ignore them.
But this phrase isn't entirely accurate. If the ""box"" is the boundary of constraints and conditions, then 
the trick is to 
find
 the box, which may be considerably larger than you think.
The key to solving puzzles is both to recognize the constraints placed on you and to recognize the 
degrees of freedom you 
do
 have, for in those you'll find your solution. This is why some puzzles are so 
effective; you may dismiss potential solutions too readily.
For example, can you connect all of the dots in the following puzzle and return to the starting poin
t
with just three straight lines—without lifting your pen from the paper or retracing your steps 
[
Hol78
]?
 You must challenge any preconceived notions and evaluate whether or not they are real, 
hard-and-fast constraints.
It's not whether you think inside the box or outside the box. The problem lies in 
finding
 th
e
box—identifying the real constraints
.
Tip 55
Don't Think Outside the Box
—
Find
 the Box
When faced with an intractable problem, enumerate 
all
 the possible avenues you have before you. 
Don't dismiss anything, no matter how unusable or stupid it sounds. Now go through the list and 
explain why a certain path cannot be taken. Are you sure? Can you 
prove
 it?
Consider the Trojan horse—a novel solution to an intractable problem. How do you get troops into 
a
walled city without being discovered? You can bet that ""through the front door"" was initially dismisse
d
as suicide
.
Categorize and prioritize your constraints. When woodworkers begin a project, they cut the longest 
pieces first, then cut the smaller pieces out of the remaining wood. In the same manner, we want to 
identify the most restrictive constraints first, and fit the remaining constraints within them.
By the way, a solution to the Four Posts puzzle is shown on page 307.
There Must Be an Easier Way!
Sometimes you will find yourself working on a problem that seems much harder than you thought i
t
should be. Maybe it feels like you're going down the wrong path—that there must be an easier wa
y
than this! Perhaps you are running late on the schedule now, or even despair of ever getting th
e
system to work because this particular problem is ""impossible.
""
That's when you step back a pace and ask yourself these questions:
Is
 there an easier way?
Are you trying to solve the right problem, or have you been distracted by a peripheral 
technicality?
Why
 is this thing a problem?
What is it that's making it so hard to solve?
 Does it have to be done this way?
Does it have to be done at all?
Many times a surprising revelation will come to you as you try to answer one of these questions. Man
y
times a reinterpretation of the requirements can make a whole set of problems go away—just like th
e
Gordian knot
.
All you need are the real constraints, the misleading constraints, and the wisdom to know the 
difference.

Take a hard look at whatever difficult problem you are embroiled in today. Can you cut the 
Gordian knot? Ask yourself the key questions we outlined above, especially 
""Does it have to 
be done this way?""
Were you handed a set of constraints when you signed on to your current project? Are they 
all still applicable, and is the interpretation of them still valid?

Not Until You're Ready
He who hesitates is sometimes saved.
James Thurber, 
The Glass in the Field
Great performers share a trait: they know when to start and when to wait. The diver stands on the 
high-board, waiting for the perfect moment to jump. The conductor stands before the orchestra, arms 
raised, until she senses that the moment is right to start the piece.
You are a great performer. You too need to listen to the voice that whispers ""wait."" If you sit down to 
start typing and there's some nagging doubt in your mind, heed it.
Tip 56
Listen to Nagging Doubts—Start When You're Read
y
There used to be a style of tennis coaching called ""inner tennis."" You'd spend hours hitting balls over 
the net, not particularly trying for accuracy, but instead verbalizing just where the ball hit relative to 
some target (often a chair). The idea was that the feedback would train your subconscious and 
reflexes, so that you improved without consciously knowing how or why.
As a developer, you've been doing the same kind of thing during your entire career. You've been trying 
things and seeing which worked and which didn't. You've been accumulating experience and wisdom. 
When you feel a nagging doubt, or experience some reluctance when faced with a task, heed it. You 
may not be able to put your finger on exactly what's wrong, but give it time and your doubts will 
probably crystallize into something more solid, something you can address. Software development is 
still not a science. Let your instincts contribute to your performance.
Good Judgment or Procrastination?
Everyone fears the blank sheet of paper. Starting a new project (or even a new module in an existing 
project) can be an unnerving experience. Many of us would prefer to put off making the initial 
commitment of starting. So how can you tell when you're simply procrastinating, rather than 
responsibly waiting for all the pieces to fall into place?
A technique that has worked for us in these circumstances is to start prototyping. Choose an area that 
you feel will be difficult and begin producing some kind of proof of concept. One of two things will 
typically happen. Shortly after starting, you may feel that you're wasting your time. This boredom is 
probably a good indication that your initial reluctance was just a desire to put off the commitment to 
start. Give up on the prototype, and hack into the real development.
 On the other hand, as the prototype progresses you may have one of those moments of revelation 
when you suddenly realize that some basic premise was wrong. Not only that, but you'll see clearly 
how you can put it right. You'll feel comfortable abandoning the prototype and launching into the 
project proper. Your instincts were right, and you've just saved yourself and your team a considerable 
amount of wasted effort.
When you make the decision to prototype as a way of investigating your unease, be sure to remember 
why you're doing it. The last thing you want is to find yourself several weeks into serious development 
before remembering that you started out writing a prototype.
Somewhat cynically, starting work on a prototype might also be more politically acceptable than simply 
announcing that ""I don't feel right about starting"" and firing up 
solitaire.
Challenges
Discuss the fear-of-starting syndrome with your colleagues. Do others experience the same 
thing? Do they heed it? What tricks do they use to overcome it? Can a group help overcome 
an individual's reluctance, or is that just peer pressure?

The Specification Trap
The Landing Pilot is the Non-Handling Pilot until the 'decision altitude' call, when the Handling 
Non-Landing Pilot hands the handling to the Non-Handling Landing Pilot, unless the latter calls 
'go-around,' in which case the Handling Non-Landing Pilot continues handling and the Non-Handling 
Landing Pilot continues non-handling until the next call of 'land' or 'go-around' as appropriate. In view 
of recent confusions over these rules, it was deemed necessary to restate them clearly.
British Airways memorandum, quoted in Pilot Magazine, December 1996
Program specification is the process of taking a requirement and reducing it down to the point where 
a
programmer's skill can take over. It is an act of communication, explaining and clarifying the world i
n
such a way as to remove major ambiguities. As well as talking to the developer who will be performin
g
the initial implementation, the specification is a record for future generations of programmers who wil
l
be maintaining and enhancing the code. The specification is also an agreement with the user—
a
codification of their needs and an implicit contract that the final system will be in line with tha
t
requirement
.
Writing a specification is quite a responsibility.
The problem is that many designers find it difficult to stop. They feel that unless every little detail is 
pinned down in excruciating detail they haven't earned their daily dollar.
This is a mistake for several reasons. First, it's naive to assume that a specification will ever captur
e
every detail and nuance of a system or its requirement. In restricted problem domains, there ar
e
formal methods that can describe a system, but they still require the designer to explain the meanin
g
of the notation to the end users—there is still a human interpretation going on to mess things up. Eve
n
without the problems inherent in this interpretation, it is very unlikely that the average user know
s
going in to a project exactly what they need. They may say they have an understanding of th
e
requirement, and they may sign off on the 200-page document you produce, but you can guarante
e
that once they see the running system you'll be inundated with change requests
.
Second, there is a problem with the expressive power of language itself. All the diagramming 
techniques and formal methods still rely on natural language expressions of the operations to be 
performed.
[2]
 And natural language is really not up to the job. Look at the wording of any contract: i
n
an attempt to be precise, lawyers have to bend the language in the most unnatural ways.
[2]
 There are some formal techniques that attempt to express operations algebraically, but thes
e
techniques are rarely used in practice. They still require that the analysts explain the meaning to the end 
users.
Here's a challenge for you. Write a short description that tells someone how to tie bows in their 
shoelaces. Go on, try it!

Tip 57
Some Things Are Better Done than Described
Finally, there is the straightjacket effect. A design that leaves the coder no room for interpretation robs 
the programming effort of any skill and art. Some would say this is for the best, but they're wrong. 
Often, it is only during coding that certain options become apparent. While coding, you may think 
""Look at that. Because of the particular way I coded this routine, I could add this additional functionality 
with almost no effort""
 or 
""The specification says to do this, but I could achieve an almost identical 
result by doing it a different way, and I could do it in half the time.""
 Clearly, you shouldn't just hack in 
and make the changes, but you wouldn't even have spotted the opportunity if you were constrained by 
an overly prescriptive design.
As a Pragmatic Programmer, you should tend to view requirements gathering, design, an
d
implementation as different facets of the same process—the delivery of a quality system. Distrus
t
environments where requirements are gathered, specifications are written, and then coding starts, al
l
in isolation. Instead, try to adopt a seamless approach: specification and implementation are simpl
y
different aspects of the same process—an attempt to capture and codify a requirement. Each shoul
d
flow directly into the next, with no artificial boundaries. You'll find that a healthy development proces
s
encourages feedback from implementation and testing into the specification process
.
Just to be clear, we are not against generating specifications. Indeed, we recognize that there ar
e
times where incredibly detailed specifications are demanded—for contractual reasons, because of th
e
environment where you work, or because of the nature of the product you are developing
.
[3]
 Just b
e
aware that you reach a point of diminishing, or even negative, returns as the specifications get more 
and more detailed. Also be careful about building specifications layered on top of specifications, 
without any supporting implementation or prototyping; it's all too easy to specify something that can't 
be built.
[3]
 Detailed specifications are clearly appropriate for life-critical systems. We feel they should also b
e
produced for interfaces and libraries used by others. When your entire output is seen as a set of routine 
calls, you'd better make sure those calls are well specified.
The longer you allow specifications to be security blankets, protecting developers from the scary world 
of writing code, the harder it will be to move on to hacking out code. Don't fall into this specification 
spiral: at some point, you need to start coding! If you find your team all wrapped up in warm, comfy 
specifications, break them out. Look at prototyping, or consider a tracer bullet development.

The shoelace example mentioned in the text is an interesting illustration of the problems of 
written descriptions. Did you consider describing the process using diagrams rather than 
words? Photographs? Some formal notation from topology? Models with wire laces? How 
would you teach a toddler?
Sometimes a picture is worth more than any number of words. Sometimes it is worthless. If 
you find yourself overspecifying, would pictures or special notations help? How detailed do 
they have to be? When is a drawing tool better than a whiteboard?

From structured programming, through chief programmer teams, CASE tools, waterfall development
,
the spiral model, Jackson, ER diagrams, Booch clouds, OMT, Objectory, and Coad/Yourdon, t
o
today's UML, computing has never been short of methods intended to make programming more lik
e
engineering. Each method gathers its disciples, and each enjoys a period of popularity. Then each i
s
replaced by the next. Of all of them, perhaps only the first—structured programming— has enjoyed 
a
long life
.
Yet some developers, adrift in a sea of sinking projects, keep clinging to the latest fad just as 
shipwreck victims latch onto passing driftwood. As each new piece floats by they painfully swim over, 
hoping it will be better. At the end of the day, though, it doesn't matter how good the flotsam is, the 
developers are still aimlessly adrift.
Don't get us wrong. We like (some) formal techniques and methods. But we believe that blindly 
adopting any technique without putting it into the context of your development practices and 
capabilities is a recipe for disappointment.
Tip 58
Don't Be a Slave to Formal Methods
Formal methods have some serious shortcomings.
Most formal methods capture requirements using a combination of diagrams and som
e
supporting words. These pictures represent the designers' understanding of the requirements
.
However in many cases these diagrams are meaningless to the end users, so the designer
s
have to interpret them. Therefore, there is no real formal checking of the requirements by th
e
actual user of the system—everything is based on the designers' explanations, just as i
n
old-fashioned written requirements. We see some benefit in capturing requirements this way
,
but we prefer, where possible, to show the user a prototype and let them play with it
.
Formal methods seem to encourage specialization. One group of people works on a data 
model, another looks at the architecture, while requirements gatherers collect use cases (or 
their equivalent). We've seen this lead to poor communication and wasted effort. There is also 
a tendency to fall back into the 
us versus them
 mentality of designers against coders. We 
prefer to understand the whole of the system we're working on. It may not be possible to have 
 an in-depth grasp of every aspect of a system, but you should know how the components 
interact, where the data lives, and what the requirements are.
We like to write adaptable, dynamic systems, using metadata to allow us to change the 
character of applications at runtime. Most current formal methods combine a static object or 
data model with some kind of event- or activity-charting mechanism. We haven't yet come 
across one that allows us to illustrate the kind of dynamism we feel systems should exhibit. In 
fact, most formal methods will lead you astray, encouraging you to set up static relationships 
between objects that really should be knitted together dynamically.
Do Methods Pay Off?

" reviews the research into the productivity and quality 
improvements gained using seven different software development technologies (4GLs, structured 
techniques, CASE tools, formal methods, clean room methodology, process models, and object 
orientation). He reports that the initial hype surrounding all of these methods was overblown. Although 
there is an indication that some methods have benefits, these benefits start to manifest themselves 
only after a significant productivity and quality drop while the technique is adopted and its users train 
themselves. Never underestimate the cost of adopting new tools and methods. Be prepared to treat 
the first projects using these techniques as a learning experience.
Should We Use Formal Methods?
Absolutely. But always remember that formal development methods are just one more tool in th
e
toolbox. If, after careful analysis, you feel you need to use a formal method, then embrace it—bu
t
remember who is in charge. Never become a slave to a methodology: circles and arrows make poo
r
masters. Pragmatic Programmers look at methodologies critically, then extract the best from each an
d
meld them into a set of working practices that gets better each month. This is crucial. You should wor
k
constantly to refine and improve your processes. Never accept the rigid confines of a methodology a
s
the limits of your world
.
Don't give in to the false authority of a method. People may walk into meetings with an acre of class 
diagrams and 150 use cases, but all that paper is still just their fallible interpretation of requirements 
and design. Try not to think about how much a tool cost when you look at its output.
Tip 59
Expensive Too Do Not Produce Better Designs
Formal methods certainly have their place in development. However, if you come across a project 
where the philosophy is ""the class diagram is the application, the rest is mechanical coding,"" you know 
you're looking at a waterlogged project team and a long paddle home.

Challenges
Use case diagrams are part of the UML process for gathering requirements (see 
The 
Requirements Pit
). Are they an effective way of communicating with your users? If not, why 
are you using them?
How can you tell if a formal method is bringing your team benefits? What can you measure? 
What constitutes an improvement? Can you distinguish between benefits of the tool and 
increased experience on the part of team members?
Where is the break-even point for introducing new methods to your team? How do you 
evaluate the trade-off between future benefits and current losses of productivity as the tool is 
introduced?
Are tools that work for large projects good for small ones? How about the other way around?

Chapter 8. Pragmatic Project
s
As your project gets under way, we need to move away from issues of individual philosophy and 
coding to talk about larger, project-sized issues. We aren't going to go into specifics of project 
management, but we will talk about a handful of critical areas that can make or break any project.
As soon as you have more than one person working on a project, you need to establish some ground 
rules and delegate parts of the project accordingly. In 
Pragmatic Teams,
 we'll show how to do this 
while honoring the pragmatic philosophy.
The single most important factor in making project-level activities work consistently and reliably is to 
automate your procedures. We'll explain why, and show some real-life examples in 
Ubiquitous 
Automation.
Earlier, we talked about testing as you code. In 
Ruthless Testing,
 we go to the next step o
f
project-wide testing philosophy and tools—especially if you don't have a large QA staff at your bec
k
and call
.
The only thing that developers dislike more than testing is documentation. Whether you have technical 
writers helping you or are doing it on your own, we'll show you how to make the chore less painful and 
more productive in 
It's All Writing.
Success is in the eye of the beholder—the sponsor of the project. The perception of success is wha
t
counts, and in
 
Great Expectations
 we'll show you some tricks to delight every project's sponsor.
The last tip in the book is a direct consequence of all the rest. In 
Pride and Prejudice,
 we encourage 
you to sign your work, and to take pride in what you do.

Pragmatic Teams
At Group L, Stoffel oversees six first-rate programmers, a managerial challenge 
roughly comparable to herding cats.
The Washington Post Magazine, June 9, 1985
So far in this book we've looked at pragmatic techniques that help an individual be a better 
programmer. Can these methods work for teams as well?
The answer is a resounding ""yes!"" There are advantages to being a pragmatic individual, 
but these advantages are multiplied manyfold if the individual is working on a pragmatic 
team.
In this section we'll look briefly at how pragmatic techniques can be applied to teams as a 
whole. These notes are only a start. Once you've got a group of pragmatic developers 
working in an enabling environment, they'll quickly develop and refine their own team 
dynamics that work for them.
Let's recast some of the previous sections in terms of teams.
No Broken Windows
Quality is a team issue. The most diligent developer placed on a team that just doesn't care 
will find it difficult to maintain the enthusiasm needed to fix niggling problems. The problem 
is further exacerbated if the team actively discourages the developer from spending time 
on these fixes.
Teams as a whole should not tolerate broken windows—those small imperfections that n
o
one fixes. The team
 
must
 take responsibility for the quality of the product, supporting 
developers who understand the 
no broken windows
 philosophy we describe in 
Software 
Entropy
, and encouraging those who haven't yet discovered it.
Some team methodologies have a 
quality officer
—someone to whom the team delegate
s
the responsibility for the quality of the deliverable. This is clearly ridiculous: quality ca
n
come only from the individual contributions of
 
all
 team members.
 Boiled Frogs
Remember the poor frog in the pan of water, back in 
Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs?
 It 
doesn't notice the gradual change in its environment, and ends up cooked. The same can 
happen to individuals who aren't vigilant. It can be difficult to keep an eye on your overall 
environment in the heat of project development.
It's even easier for teams as a whole to get boiled. People assume that someone else is 
handling an issue, or that the team leader must have OK'd a change that your user is 
requesting. Even the best-intentioned teams can be oblivious to significant changes in their 
projects.
Fight this. Make sure everyone actively monitors the environment for changes. Maybe 
appoint a 
chief water tester.
 Have this person check constantly for increased scope
,
decreased time scales, additional features, new environments—anything that wasn't in th
e
original agreement. Keep metrics on new","[0.033300444, 0.06413631, 0.019859903, -0.0049434826, 0.022238506, -0.0058032186, -0.020605007, 0.029890157, -0.013641146, 0.03754181, 0.0954307, -0.037341204, -0.04868972,

t
reject changes out of hand—you simply need to be aware that they're happening
.
Otherwise, it'll be

Communicate
It's obvious that developers in a team must talk to each other. We gave some suggestions 
to facilitate this in 
Communicate!
. However, it's easy to forget that the team itself has a 
presence within the organization. The team as an entity needs to communicate clearly with 
the rest of the world.
To outsiders, the worst project teams are those that appear sullen and reticent. They hold 
meetings with no structure, where no one wants to talk. Their documents are a mess: no 
two look the same, and each uses different terminology.
Great project teams have a distinct personality. People look forward to meetings with them, 
because they know that they'll see a well-prepared performance that makes everyone feel 
good. The documentation they produce is crisp, accurate, and consistent. The team 
speaks with one voice.
[1]
 They may even have a sense of humor
.
[1]
 The team speaks with one voice-externally. Internally, we strongly encourage lively, robust debate
.
Good developers tend to be passionate about their work.
There is a simple marketing trick that helps teams communicate as one: generate a brand. 
 When you start a project, come up with a name for it, ideally something off-the-wall. (In the 
past, we've named projects after things such as killer parrots that prey on sheep, optical 
illusions, and mythical cities.) Spend 30 minutes coming up with a zany logo, and use it on 
your memos and reports. Use your team's name liberally when talking with people. It 
sounds silly, but it gives your team an identity to build on, and the world something 
memorable to associate with your work.
Don't Repeat Yourself
In 
The Evils of Duplication
, we talked about the difficulties of eliminating duplicated work 
between members of a team. This duplication leads to wasted effort, and can result in a 
maintenance nightmare. Clearly good communication can help here, but sometimes 
something extra is needed.
Some teams appoint a member as the project librarian, responsible for coordinating 
documentation and code repositories. Other team members can use this person as the first 
port of call when they're looking for something. A good librarian will also be able to spot 
impending duplication by reading the material that they're handling.
When the project's too big for one librarian (or when no one wants to play the role), appoint 
people as focal points for various functional aspects of the work. If people want to talk over 
date handling, they should know to talk with Mary. If there's a database schema issue, see 
Fred.
And don't forget the value of groupware systems and local Usenet news-groups for 
communicating and archiving questions and answers.
Orthogonality
Traditional team organization is based on the old-fashioned waterfall method of software 
construction. Individuals are assigned roles based on their job function. You'll find business 
analysts, architects, designers, programmers, testers, documenters, and the like.

is an implicit hierarchy here—the closer to the user you're allowed, the more senior yo

 In
 
The Rational Unified Process: An Introduction,
 the author identifies 27 separate roles within a 
project team! [
Kru98
]
Taking things to the extreme, some development cultures dictate strict divisions of 
 responsibility; coders aren't allowed to talk to testers, who in turn aren't allowed to talk to 
the chief architect, and so on. Some organizations then compound the problem by having 
different sub-teams report through separate management chains.
It is a mistake to think that the activities of a project—analysis, design, coding, an
d
testing—can happen in isolation. They can't. These are different views of the sam
e
problem, and artificially separating them can cause a boatload of trouble. Programmer
s
who are two or three levels removed from the actual users of their code are unlikely to b
e
aware of the context in which their work is used. They will not be able to make informe
d
decisions
.
Tip 60
Organize Around Functionality, Not Job Functions
We favor splitting teams functionally. Divide your people into small teams, each 
responsible for a particular functional aspect of the final system. Let the teams organize 
themselves internally, building on individual strengths as they can. Each team has 
responsibilities to others in the project, as defined by their agreed-upon commitments. The 
exact set of commitments changes with each project, as does the allocation of people into 
teams.
Functionality here does not necessarily mean end-user use cases. The database acces
s
layer counts, as does the help subsystem. We're looking for cohesive, largel
y
self-contained teams of people—exactly the same criteria we should be using when w
e
modularize code. There are warning signs that the team organization is wrong—a classi
c
example is having two subteams working on the same program module or class
.
How does this functional style of organization help? Organize our resources using the 
same techniques we use to organize code, using techniques such as contracts (
Design by 
Contract
), decoupling (
Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
), and orthogonality 
(
Orthogonality
), and we help isolate the team as a whole from the effects of change. If the 
user suddenly decides to change database vendors, only the database team should be 
affected. Should marketing suddenly decide to use an off-the-shelf tool for the calendar 
function, the calendar group takes a hit. Properly executed, this kind of group approach can 
dramatically reduce the number of interactions between individuals' work, reducing time 
 scales, increasing quality, and cutting down on the number of defects. This approach can 
also lead to a more committed set of developers. Each team knows that they alone are 
responsible for a particular function, so they feel more ownership of their output.
However, this approach works only with responsible developers and strong projec
t
management. Creating a pool of autonomous teams and letting them loose withou
t
leadership is a recipe for disaster. The project needs at least two ""heads""—one technical
,
the other administrative. The technical head sets the development philosophy and style
,
assigns responsibilities to teams, and arbitrates the inevitable ""discussions"" betwee
n
people. The technical head also looks constantly at the big picture, trying to find an
y
unnecessary commonality between teams that could reduce the orthogonality of the overal
l
effort. The administrative head, or project manager, schedules the resources that th
e
teams need, monitors and reports on progress, and helps decide priorities in terms o
f
business needs. The administrative head might also act as the team's ambassador whe

communicating with the outside world
.
Teams on larger projects need additional resources: a librarian who indexes and stores 
code and documentation, a tool builder who provides common tools and environments, 
operational support, and so on.
This type of team organization is similar in spirit to the old chief programmer team concept, 
first documented in 1972 [
Bak72
].
Automation
A great way to ensure both consistency and accuracy is to automate everything the team 
does. Why lay code out manually when your editor can do it automatically as you type? 
Why complete test forms when the overnight build can run tests automatically?
Automation is an essential component of every project team—important enough for us t
o
dedicate an entire section to it, starting on the following page. To ensure that things ge
t
automated, appoint one or more team members as
 
tool builders
 to construct and deploy 
the tools that automate the project drudgery. Have them produce makefiles, shell scripts, 
editor templates, utility programs, and the like.
Know When to Stop Adding Paint
Remember that teams are made up of individuals. Give each member the ability to shine in 
his or her own way. Give them just enough structure to support them and to ensure that the 
 project delivers against its requirements. Then, like the painter in 
Good-Enough Software
, 
resist the temptation to add more paint.

Challenges
Look around for successful teams outside the area of software development. What 
makes them successful? Do they use any of the processes discussed in this 
section?
Next time you start a project, try convincing people to brand it. Give your 
organization time to become used to the idea, and then do a quick audit to see 
what difference it made, both within the team and externally.
Team Algebra: In school, we are given problems such as ""If it takes 4 workers 6 
hours to dig a ditch, how long would it take 8 workers?"" In real life, however, what 
factors affect the answer to: ""If it takes 4 programmers 6 months to develop an 
application, how long would it take 8 programmers?"" In how many scenarios is the 
time actually reduced?

Ubiquitous Automation
Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations we can 
perform without thinking.
Alfred North Whitehead
At the dawn of the age of automobiles, the instructions for starting a Model-T Ford wer
e
more than two pages long. With modern cars, you just turn the key—the starting procedur
e
is automatic and foolproof. A person following a list of instructions might flood the engine
,
but the automatic starter won't
.
Although computing is still an industry at the Model-T stage, we can't afford to go through 
two pages of instructions again and again for some common operation. Whether it is the 
build and release procedure, code review paperwork, or any other recurring task on the 
project, it has to be automatic. We may have to build the starter and fuel injector from 
scratch, but once it's done, we can just turn the key from then on.
In addition, we want to ensure consistency and repeatability on the project. Manual 
procedures leave consistency up to chance; repeatability isn't guaranteed, especially if 
aspects of the procedure are open to interpretation by different people.
All on Automatic
We were once at a client site where all the developers were using the same IDE. Thei
r
system administrator gave each developer a set of instructions on installing add-o
n
packages to the IDE. These instructions filled many pages—pages full of click here, scrol
l
there, drag this, double-click that, and do it again
.
Not surprisingly, every developer's machine was loaded slightly differently. Subtle 
differences in the application's behavior occurred when different developers ran the same 
code. Bugs would appear on one machine but not on others. Tracking down version 
differences of any one component usually revealed a surprise.
Tip 61
Don't Use Manual Procedures
 People just aren't as repeatable as computers are. Nor should we expect them to be. A 
shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after 
time. It can be put under source control, so you can examine changes to the procedure 
over time as well (""but it 
used
 to work…"")
.
Another favorite tool of automation is 
cron
 (or 
""at""
 on Windows NT). It allows us to schedul
e
unattended tasks to run periodically—usually in the middle of the night. For example, th
e
following
 
crontab
 file specifies that a project's 
nightly
 command be run at five minutes past 
midnight every day, that the backup be run at 3:15 a.m. on weekdays, and that 
expense_reports
 be run at midnight on the first of the month.
                                       
 
    # 
MIN HOUR DAY MONTH DAYOFWEEK   COMMAND
    # ---------------------------------------------------------------

        0    0   1     *     *       /home/accounting/expense_reports
Using 
cron,
 we can schedule backups, the nightly build, Web site maintenance, an
d
anything else that needs to be done—unattended, automatically
.
Compiling the Project
Compiling the project is a chore that should be reliable and repeat-able. We generally 
compile projects with makefiles, even when using an IDE environment. There are several 
advantages in using makefiles. It is a scripted, automatic procedure. We can add in hooks 
to generate code for us, and run regression tests automatically. IDEs have their 
advantages, but with IDEs alone it can be hard to achieve the level of automation that 
we're looking for. We want to check out, build, test, and ship with a single command.
Generating Code
In 
The Evils of Duplication
, we advocated generating code to derive knowledge from 
common sources. We can exploit 
make
's dependency analysis mechanism to make this 
process easy. It's a pretty simple matter to add rules to a makefile to generate a file from 
some other source automatically. For example, suppose we wanted to take an XML file, 
 generate a Java file from it, and compile the result.
                                               
 
    .SUFFIXES: .Java .class .xml
    .xml.java:
            perl convert.pl $<  > $@
    .Java.class:
            $(JAVAC) $(JAVAC_FLAGS) $<
Type 
make test.class,
 and 
make
 will automatically look for a file named 
test.xml","[0.015845194, 0.028403781, 0.023099784, -0.0071543865, 0.02144312, -0.018250031, 0.010594637, -0.0034235509, -0.026105829, 0.0390385, 0.07203819, 0.012364863, -0.016058959, -0.03171711,

"Type 
make test.class,
 and 
make
 will automatically look for a file named 
test.xml,
 build a 
.java
 file by running a Perl script, and then compile that file to produce 
test.class.
We can use the same sort of rules to generate source code, header files, or documentation 
automatically from some other form as well (see 
Code Generators
).
Regression Tests
You can also use the makefile to run regression tests for you, either for an individual 
module or for an entire subsystem. You can easily test the 
entire
 project with just one 
command at the top of the source tree, or you can test an individual module by using the 
same command in a single directory. See 
Ruthless Testing
, for more on regression testing.
Recursive make
Many projects set up recursive, hierarchical for project builds and testing. But be 
aware of some potential problems.
make
 calculates dependencies between the various targets it has to build. But it 
can analyze only the dependencies that exist within one single 
make
 invocation. 
In particular, a recursive 
make
 has no knowledge of dependencies that other 
invocations of 
make
 may have. If you are careful and precise, you can get th
e
proper results, but it's easy to cause extra work unnecessarily—or miss 
a
dependency and
 
not
 recompile when it's needed.
In addition, build dependencies may not be the same as test dependencies, and 
you may need separate hierarchies.
 Build Automation
A 
build
 is a procedure that takes an empty directory (and a known compilatio
n
environment) and builds the project from scratch, producing whatever you hope to produc
e
as a final deliverable—a CD-ROM master image or a self-extracting archive, for instance
.
Typically a project build will encompass the following steps
.
Check out the source code from the repository.
1
.
Build the project from scratch, typically from a top-level makefile. Each build is 
marked with some form of release or version number, or perhaps a date stamp.
2
.
Create a distributable image. This procedure may entail fixing file ownership and 
permissions, and producing all examples, documentation, README files, and 
anything else that will ship with the product, in the exact format that will be required 
when you ship.
[3]
[3]
 If you are producing a CD-ROM in ISO9660 format, for example, you would run th
e
program that produces a bit-for-bit image of the 9660 file system. Why wait until the night 
before you ship to make sure it works?
3
.
Run specified tests (
make test
).
4
.
For most projects, this level of build is run automatically every night. In this nightly build, 
you will typically run more complete tests than an individual might run while building some 
specific portion of the project. The important point is to have the full build run 
all
 available 
tests. You want to know if a regression test failed because of one of today's code changes. 
By identifying the problem close to the source, you stand a better chance of finding and 
fixing it.
When you don't run tests regularly, you may discover that the application broke due to a 
code change made three months ago. Good luck finding that one.
Final Builds
Final builds,
 which you intend to ship as products, may have different requirements from 
the regular nightly build. A final build may require that the repository be locked, or tagged 
with the release number, that optimization and debug flags be set differently, and so on. 
We like to use a separate 
make
 target (such as 
make final
) that sets all of these 
parameters at once.
 Remember that if the product is compiled differently from earlier versions, then you must 
test against 
this
 version all over again.
Automatic Administrivia
Wouldn't it be nice if programmers could actually devote all of their time to programming? 
Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. There is e-mail to be answered, paperwork to be filled 
out, documents to be posted to the Web, and so on. You may decide to create a shell 
script to do some of the dirty work, but you still have to remember to run the script when 
needed.
Because memory is the second thing you lose as you age,
[4]
 we don't want to rely on it to
o
heavily. We can run scripts to perform procedures for us automatically, based on the 
content
 of source code and documents. Our goal is to maintain an automatic, unattended, 
content-driven workflow.
[4]
 What's the first? I forget
.
Web Site Generation
Many development teams use an internal Web site for project communication, and we think 
this is a great idea. But we don't want to spend too much time maintaining the Web site, 
and we don't want to let it get stale or out of date. Misleading information is worse than no 
information at all.
Documentation that is extracted from code, requirements analyses, design documents, and 
any drawings, charts, or graphs all need to be published to the Web on a regular basis. We
like to publish these documents automatically as part of the nightly build or as a hook into 
the source code check-in procedure.
However it is done, Web content should be generated automatically from information in the 
repository and published 
without
 human intervention. This is really another application of 
the 
DRY
 principle: information exists in one form as checked-in code and documents. Th
e
view from the Web browser is simply that—just a view. You shouldn't have to maintain tha
t
view by hand
.
Any information generated by the nightly build should be accessible on the development 
Web site: results of the build itself (for example, the build results might be presented as a 
one-page summary that includes compiler warnings, errors, and current status), regression 
 tests, performance statistics, coding metrics and any other static analysis, and so on.
Approval Procedures
Some projects have various administrative workflows that must be followed. For instance
,
code or design reviews need to be scheduled and followed through, approvals may need t
o
be granted, and so on. We can use automation—and especially the Web site—to hel
p
ease the paperwork burden
.
Suppose you wanted to automate code review scheduling and approval. You might put a 
special marker in each source code file:
                                               
 
     /* 
Status: needs_review
 */
A simple script could go through all of the source code and look for all files that had a 
status of 
needs_review,
 indicating that they were ready to be reviewed. You could then 
post a list of those files as a Web page, automatically send e-mail to the appropriate 
people, or even schedule a meeting automatically using some calendar software.
You can set up a form on a Web page for the reviewers to register approval or disapproval. 
After the review, the status can be automatically changed to 
reviewed.
 Whether you have a 
code walk-through with all the participants is up to you; you can still do the paperwork 
automatically. (In an article in the April 1999 CACM, Robert Glass summarizes research 
that seems to indicate that, while","[0.010485952, 0.047391422, 0.030088896, -0.0014800999, 0.015256143, -0.028084852, 0.018600922, -0.0038846007, -0.009138161, 0.0589923, 0.051230155, 0.0034629751,

The Cobbler's Children
The cobbler's children have no shoes. Often, people who develop software use the poorest 
tools to do the job.
But we have all the raw materials we need to craft better tools. We have 
cron.
 We have 
make,
 on both Windows and Unix platforms. And we have Perl and other high-level 
scripting languages for quickly developing custom tools, Web page generators, code 
generators, test harnesses, and so on.
Let the computer do the repetitious, the mundane—it will do a better job of it than w
e
would. We've got more important and more difficult things to do
.

Challenges
Look at your habits throughout the workday. Do you see any repetitive tasks? Do 
you type the same sequence of commands over and over again?
Try writing a few shell scripts to automate the process. Do you always click on the 
same sequence of icons repeatedly? Can you create a macro to do all that for you?
How much of your project paperwork can be automated? Given the high expense 
of programming staff,
[5]
 determine how much of the project's budget is being waste

on administrative procedures. Can you justify the amount of time it would take to 
craft an automated solution based on the overall cost savings it would achieve?

Ruthless Testing
Most developers hate testing. They tend to test gently, subconsciously knowing where the 
code will break and avoiding the weak spots. Pragmatic Programmers are different. We are 
driven
 to find our bugs 
now,
 so we don't have to endure the shame of others finding our 
bugs later.
Finding bugs is somewhat like fishing with a net. We use fine, small nets (unit tests) to 
catch the minnows, and big, coarse nets (integration tests) to catch the killer sharks. 
Sometimes the fish manage to escape, so we patch any holes that we find, in hopes of 
catching more and more slippery defects that are swimming about in our project pool.
Tip 62
Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically.
We want to start testing as soon as we have code. Those tiny minnows have a nasty habit 
of becoming giant, man-eating sharks pretty fast, and catching a shark is quite a bit harder. 
But we don't want to have to do all that testing by hand.
Many teams develop elaborate test plans for their projects. Sometimes they will even use 
them. But we've found that teams that use automated tests have a much better chance of 
success. Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on 
a shelf.
The earlier a bug is found, the cheaper it is to remedy. ""Code a little, test a little"" is a 
popular saying in the Smalltalk world,
[6]
 and we can adopt that mantra as our own b
y
writing test code at the same time (or even before) we write the production code.
[6]
 eXtreme Programming 
[
URL 45
] calls this concept ""continuous Integration, relentless testing.""
In fact, a good project may well have 
more
 test code than production code. The time it 
takes to produce this test code is worth the effort. It ends up being much cheaper in the 
long run, and you actually stand a chance of producing a product with close to zero 
 defects.
Additionally, knowing that you've passed the test gives you a high degree of confidence 
that a piece of code is ""done.""
Tip 63
Coding Ain't Done 'Til All the Tests Run
Just because you have finished hacking out a piece of code doesn't mean you can go tell 
your boss or your client that it's 
done.
 It's not. First of all, code is never really done. More 
importantly, you can't claim that it is usable by anyone until it passes all of the available 
tests.
We need to look at three main aspects of project-wide testing: what to test, how to test, and 
when to test.
What to Test
There are several major types of software testing that you need to perform:
Unit testing
Integration testing
Validation and verification
Resource exhaustion, errors, and recovery
Performance testing
Usability testing
This list is by no means complete, and some specialized projects will require various other 
types of testing as well. But it gives us a good starting point.
Unit Testing
 A 
unit test
 is code that exercises a module. We covered this topic by itself in 
Code That's 
Easy to Test
. Unit testing is the foundation of all the other forms of testing that we'll discuss 
in this section. If the parts don't work by themselves, they probably won't work well 
together. All of the modules you are using must pass their own unit tests before you can 
proceed.
Once all of the pertinent modules have passed their individual tests, you're ready for the 
next stage. You need to test how all the modules use and interact with each other 
throughout the system.
Integration Testing
Integration testing
 shows that the major subsystems that make up the project work and 
play well with each other. With good contracts in place and well tested, any integration 
issues can be detected easily. Otherwise, integration becomes a fertile breeding ground for 
bugs. In fact, it is often the single largest source of bugs in the system.
Integration testing is really just an extension of the unit testing we've described—only no
w
you're testing how entire subsystems honor their contracts
.
Validation and Verification
As soon as you have an executable user interface or prototype, you need to answer an 
all-important question: the users told you what they wanted, but is it what they need?
Does it meet the functional requirements of the system? This, too, needs to be tested. A 
bug-free system that answers the wrong question isn't very useful. Be conscious of 
end-user access patterns and how they differ from developer test data (for an example, 
see the story about brush strokes on page 92).
Resource Exhaustion, Errors, and Recovery
Now that you have a pretty good idea that the system will behave correctly under ideal 
conditions, you need to discover how it will behave under 
real-world
 conditions. In the real 
world, your programs don't have limitless resources; they run out of things. A few limits 
your code may encounter include:
Memory
 Disk space
CPU bandwidth
Wall-clock time
Disk bandwidth
Network bandwidth
Color palette
Video resolution
You might actually check for disk space or memory allocation","[-0.008348877, 0.028576408, 0.053940084, 0.0047063706, 0.018092755, -0.021446398, 0.0120829735, 0.005368645, 0.0030506866, 0.056504633,

Video resolution
You might actually check for disk space or memory allocation failures, but how often do 
you test for the others? Will your application fit on a 640 × 480 screen with 256 colors? Wil
l
it run on a 1600 × 1280 screen with 24-bit color without looking like a postage stamp? Wil
l
the batch job finish before the archive starts?
You can detect environmental limitations, such as the video specifications, and adapt as 
appropriate. Not all failures are recoverable, however. If your code detects that memory 
has been exhausted, your options are limited: you may not have enough resources left to 
do anything except fail.
When the system does fail,
[7]
 will it fail gracefully? Will it try, as best it can, to save its stat
e
and prevent loss of work? Or will it ""GPF"" or ""core-dump"" in the user's face?

 Our copy editor wanted us to change this sentence to 
""

 the system does fail…."" We resisted

Performance Testing
Performance testing, stress testing, or testing under load may be an important aspect of 
the project as well.
Ask yourself if the software meets the performance requirements under real-worl
d
conditions—with the expected number of users, or connections, or transactions pe
r
second. Is it scalable
?
For some applications, you may need specialized testing hardware or software to simulate 
the load realistically.
 Usability Testing
Usability testing is different from the types of testing discussed so far. It is performed with 
real users, under real environmental conditions.
Look at usability in terms of human factors. Were there any misunderstandings during 
requirements analysis that need to be addressed? Does the software fit the user like an 
extension of the hand? (Not only do we want our own tools to fit our hands, but we want 
the tools we create for users to fit their hands as well.)
As with validation and verification, you need to perform usability testing as early as you 
can, while there is still time to make corrections. For larger projects, you may want to bring 
in human factors specialists. (If nothing else, it's fun to play with the one-way mirrors).
Failure to meet usability criteria is just as big a bug as dividing by zero.
How to Test
We've looked at 
what
 to test. Now we'll turn our attention to 
how
 to test, including:
Regression testing
Test data
Exercising GUI systems
Testing the tests
Testing thoroughly
Design/Methodology Testing
Can you test the design of the code itself and the methodology you used to build 
the software? After a fashion, yes you can. You do this by analyzing 
metrics
—measurements of various aspects of the code. The simplest metri
c
(and often the least interesting) is
 
lines
 of 
code
—how big is the code itself
?
There are a wide variety of other metrics you can use to examine code, 
 including:
McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity Metric (measures complexity of decision 
structures)
Inheritance fan-in (number of base classes) and fan-out (number of 
derived modules using this one as a parent)
Response set (see 
Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
)
Class coupling ratios (see [
URL 48
])
Some metrics are designed to give you a ""passing grade,"" while others are 
useful only by comparison. That is, you calculate these metrics for every module 
in the system and see how a particular module relates to its brethren. Standard 
statistical techniques (such as mean and standard deviation) are usually used 
here.
If you find a module whose metrics are markedly different from all the rest, you 
need to ask yourself if that is appropriate. For some modules, it may be okay to 
""blow the curve."" But for those that 
don't
 have a good excuse, it can indicate 
problems.
Regression Testing
A regression test compares the output of the current test with previous (or known) values. 
We can ensure that bugs we fixed today didn't break things that were working yesterday. 
This is an important safety net, and it cuts down on unpleasant surprises.
All of the tests we've mentioned so far can be run as regression tests, ensuring that we 
haven't lost any ground as we develop new code. We can run regressions to verify 
performance, contracts, validity, and so on.
Test Data
Where do we get the data to run all these tests? There are only two kinds of data: 
real-world data and synthetic data. We actually need to use both, because the different 
natures of these kinds of data will expose different bugs in our software.
 Real-world data comes from some actual source. Possibly it has been collected from an 
existing system, a competitor's system, or a prototype of some sort. It represents typical 
user data. The big surprises come as you discover what 
typical
 means. This is most likely 
to reveal defects and misunderstandings in requirements analysis.
Synthetic data is artificially generated, perhaps under certain statistical constraints. You 
may need to use synthetic data for any of the following reasons.
You need a lot of data, possibly more than any real-world sample could provide. 
You might be able to use the real-world data as a seed to generate a larger sample 
set, and tweak certain fields that need to be unique.
You need data to stress the boundary conditions. This data may be completely 
synthetic: date fields containing February 29, 1999, huge record sizes, or 
addresses with foreign postal codes.
You need data that exhibits certain statistical properties. Want to see what happens 
if every third transaction fails? Remember the sort algorithm that slows to a crawl 
when handed presorted data? You can present data in random or sorted order to 
expose this kind of weakness.
Exercising GUI Systems
Testing GUI-intensive systems often requires specialized testing tools. These tools may be 
based on a simple event capture/playback model, or they may require specially written 
scripts to drive the GUI. Some systems combine elements of both.
Less sophisticated tools enforce a high degree of coupling between the version of software 
being tested and the test script itself: if you move a dialog box or make a button smaller, 
the test may not be able to find it, and may fall. Most modern GUI testing tools use a 
number of different techniques to get around this problem, and try to adjust to minor layout 
differences.
However, you can't automate everything. Andy worked on a graphics system that allowed 
the user to create and display nondeterministic visual effects which simulated various 
natural phenomena. Unfortunately, during testing you couldn't just grab a bitmap and 
compare the output with a previous run, because it was designed to be different every 
time. For situations such as this one, you may have no choice but to rely on manual 
interpretation of test results.
 One of the many advantages of writing decoupled code (see 
Decoupling and the Law of 
Demeter
) is more modular testing. For instance, for data processing applications that have 
a GUI front end, your design should be decoupled enough so that you can test the 
application logic","[-0.033495933, 0.03377004, 0.056520957, -0.0065408894, 0.028945748, -0.011772915, -0.006167418, -0.01984538, 0.0125472685, 0.07696937, 0.07664044, 0.0011495381, -0.03278325,

" front end, your design should be decoupled enough so that you can test the 
application logic 
without
 having a GUI present. This idea is similar to testing your 
subcomponents first. Once the application logic has been validated, it becomes easier to 
locate bugs that show up with the user interface in place (it's likely that the bugs were 
created by the user-interface code).
Testing the Tests
Because we can't write perfect software, it follows that we can't write perfect test software 
either. We need to test the tests.
Think of our set of test suites as an elaborate security system, designed to sound the alarm 
when a bug shows up. How better to test a security system than to try to break in?
After you have written a test to detect a particular bug, 
cause
 the bug deliberately and 
make sure the test complains. This ensures that the test will catch the bug if it happens for 
real.
Tip 64
Use Saboteurs to Test Your Testing
If you are 
really
 serious about testing, you might want to appoint a 
project saboteur.
 The 
saboteur's role is to take a separate copy of the source tree, introduce bugs on purpose, 
and verify that the tests will catch them.
When writing tests, make sure that alarms sound when they should.
Testing Thoroughly
Once you are confident that your tests are correct, and are finding bugs you create, how do 
you know if you have tested the code base thoroughly enough?
The short answer is ""you don't,"" and you never will. But there are products on the market 
 that can help. These 
coverage analysis
 tools watch your code during testing and keep 
track of which lines of code have been executed and which haven't. These tools help give 
you a general feel for how comprehensive your testing is, but don't expect to see 100% 
coverage.
Even if you do happen to hit every line of code, that's not the whole picture. What is 
important is the number of states that your program may have. States are not equivalent to 
lines of code. For instance, suppose you have a function that takes two integers, each of 
which can be a number from 0 to 999.
                                               
 
    
int
 test(
int
 a, 
int
 b) {
      
return
 a / (a + b);
    }
In theory, this three-line function has 1,000,000 logical states, 999,999 of which will work 
correctly and one that will not (when 
a + b
 equals zero). Simply knowing that you execute
d
this line of code doesn't tell you that—you would need to identify all possible states of th
e
program. Unfortunately, in general this is a
 
really hard
 problem. Hard as in, ""The sun will 
be a cold hard lump before you can solve it.""
Tip 65
Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage
Even with good code coverage, the data you use for testing still has a huge impact, and, 
more importantly, the 
order
 in which you traverse code may have the largest impact of all.
When to Test
Many projects tend to leave testing to the last minute—right where it will be cut against th
e
sharp edge of a deadline
.
[8]
 We need to start much sooner than that. As soon as an
y
production code exists, it needs to be tested.

 Most testing should be done automatically. It's important to note that by ""automatically"" we 
mean that the test 
results
 are interpreted automatically as well. See 
Ubiquitous 
Automation
, for more on this subject.
We like to test as frequently as we can, and always before we check code into the source 
repository. Some source code control systems, such as Aegis, can do this automatically. 
Otherwise, we just type
                                       
 
    % make test
Usually, it isn't a problem to run regressions on all of the individual unit tests and 
integration tests as often as needed.
But some tests may not be easily run on a such a frequent basis. Stress tests, for instance
,
may require special setup or equipment, and some hand holding. These tests may be ru
n
less often—weekly or monthly, perhaps. But it is important that they be run on a regular
,
scheduled basis. If it can't be done automatically, then make sure it appears on th
e
schedule, with all the necessary resources allocated to the task
.
Tightening the Net
Finally, we'd like to reveal the single most important concept in testing. It is an obvious one, 
and virtually every textbook says to do it this way. But for some reason, most projects still 
do not.
If a bug slips through the net of existing tests, you need to add a new test to trap it next 
time.
Tip 66
Find Bugs Once
Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the 
last
 time a human tester finds that bug. 
The automated tests should be modified to check for that particular bug from then on, 
every time, with no exceptions, no matter how trivial, and no matter how much the 
 developer complains and says, ""Oh, that will never happen again.""
Because it will happen again. And we just don't have the time to go chasing after bugs tha
t
the automated tests could have found for us. We have to spend our time writing ne
w
code—and new bugs
.

Challenges
Can you automatically test your project? Many teams are forced to answer ""no."" 
Why? Is it too hard to define the acceptable results? Won't this make it hard to 
prove to the sponsors that the project is ""done""?
Is it too hard to test the application logic independent of the GUI? What does this 
say about the GUI? About coupling?

It's All Writing
The palest ink is better than the best memory.
Chinese Proverb
Typically, developers don't give much thought to documentation. At best it is an 
unfortunate necessity; at worst it is treated as a low-priority task in the hope that 
management will forget about it at the end of the project.
Pragmatic Programmers embrace documentation as an integral part of the overal
l
development process. Writing documentation can be made easier by not duplicating effor
t
or wasting time, and by keeping documentation close at hand—in the code itself, i
f
possible
.
These aren't exactly original or novel thoughts; the idea of wedding code and 
documentation appears in Donald Knuth's work on literate programming and in Sun's 
JavaDoc utility, among others. We want to downplay the dichotomy between code and 
documentation,","[0.0046874313, 0.009610483, 0.040641062, -0.011566852, 0.032872707, -0.01983501, 0.009681883, -0.006193978, -0.015208269, 0.05946219, 0.06671646, 0.0219913, -0.0046802913,

"Doc utility, among others. We want to downplay the dichotomy between code and 
documentation, and instead treat them as two views of the same model (see 
It's Just a 
View
). In fact, we want to go a little further and apply 
all
 of our pragmatic principles to 
documentation as well as to code.
Tip 67
Treat English as Just Another Programming Language
There are basically two kinds of documentation produced for a project: internal an
d
external. Internal documentation includes source code comments, design and tes
t
documents, and so on. External documentation is anything shipped or published to th
e
outside world, such as user manuals. But regardless of the intended audience, or the rol
e
of the writer (developer or technical writer), all documentation is a mirror of the code. I
f
there's a discrepancy, the code is what matters—for better or worse
.
Tip 68
 Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On
We'll start with internal documentation.
Comments in Code
Producing formatted documents from the comments and declarations in source code is 
fairly straightforward, but first we have to ensure that we actually 
have
 comments in the 
code. Code should have comments, but too many comments can be just as bad as too 
few.
In general, comments should discuss 
why
 something is done, its purpose and its goal. The 
code already shows 
how
 it is done, so commenting on this is redundant—and is a violatio
n
of the
 
DRY
 principle.
Commenting source code gives you the perfect opportunity to document those elusive bits 
of a project that can't be documented anywhere else: engineering trade-offs, why decisions 
were made, what other alternatives were discarded, and so on.
We like to see a 
simple
 module-level header comment, comments for significant data and 
type declarations, and a brief per-class and per-method header, describing how the 
function is used and anything that it does that is not obvious.
Variable names, of course, should be well chosen and meaningful. 
foo,
 for instance, is 
meaningless, as is 
doit
 or 
manager
 or 
stuff.
 Hungarian notation (where you encode the 
variable's type information in the name itself) is utterly inappropriate in object-oriented 
systems. Remember that you (and others after you) will be 
reading
 the code many 
hundreds of times, but only 
writing
 it a few times. Take the time to spell out 
connectionPool
instead of 
cp.
Even worse than meaningless names are 
misleading
 names. Have you ever had someone 
explain inconsistencies in legacy code such as, ""The routine called 
getData
 really write
s
data to disk""? The human brain will repeatedly foul this up—it's called the
 
Stroop Effect
[
Str35
]. You can try the following experiment yourself to see the effects of such 
interference. Get some colored pens, and use them to write down the names of colors. 
 However, never write a color name using that color pen. You could write the word ""blue"" in 
green, the word ""brown"" in red, and so on. (Alternatively, we have a sample set of colors 
already drawn on our Web site at 
http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com
.) Once you have 
the color names drawn, try to say aloud the color with which each word is drawn, as fast as 
you can. At some point you'll trip up and start reading the names of the colors, and not the 
colors themselves. Names are deeply meaningful to your brain, and misleading names add 
chaos to your code.
You can document parameters, but ask yourself if it is really necessary in all cases. The 
level of comment suggested by the JavaDoc tool seems appropriate:

Here's a list of things that should not appear in source comments.
A list of the functions exported by code in the file. 
 
 There are programs tha
t
analyze source for you. Use them, and the list is guaranteed to be up to date.
Revision history. 
 
 This is what source code control systems are for (see
 
Source 
Code Control
). However, it can be useful to include information on the date of last 
change and the person who made it.
[9]
[9]
 This kind of information, as well as the filename, is provided by the RCS
 
$Id$
 tag.
A list of other files this file uses. 
 
 This can be determined more accuratel
y
using automatic tools.
The name of the file. 
 
 If it must appear in the file, don't maintain it by hand. RC
S
and similar systems can keep this information up to date automatically. If you move 
or rename the file, you don't want to have to remember to edit the header.
 One of the most important pieces of information that 
should
 appear in the source file is th
e
author's name—not necessarily who edited the file last, but the owner. Attachin
g
responsibility and accountability to source code does wonders in keeping people hones
t
(see
 
Pride and Prejudice
).
The project may also require certain copyright notices or other legal boilerplate to appear in 
each source file. Get your editor to insert these for you automatically.
With meaningful comments in place, tools such as JavaDoc [
URL 7
] and DOC++ [
URL 21
]
can extract and format them to automatically produce API-level documentation. This is on
e
specific example of a more general technique we use
—
executable documents.
Executable Documents
Suppose we have a specification that lists the columns in a database table. We'll then have 
a separate set of SQL commands to create the actual table in the database, and probably 
some kind of programming language record structure to hold the contents of a row in the 
table. The same information is repeated three times. Change any one of these three 
sources, and the other two are immediately out of date. This is a clear violation of the 
DRY
principle.
To correct this problem, we need to choose the authoritative source of information. This 
may be the specification, it may be a database schema tool, or it may be some third source 
altogether. Let's choose the specification document as the source. It's now our 
model
 for 
this process. We then need to find a way to export the information it contains as different 
views
—a database schema and a high-level language record, for example
.

"using HTML, LaTeX, or 
troff, for example), then you can use tools such as Perl to extract the schema and reformat 
it automatically. If your document is in a word processor's binary format, then see the box 
on the following page for some options.
Your document is now an integral part of the project development. The only way to change 
the schema is to change the document. You are guaranteeing that the specification, 
schema, and code all agree. You minimize the amount of work you have to do for each 
change, and you can update the views of the change automatically.
 What if My Document Isn't Plain Text?
Unfortunately, more and more project documents are now being written using 
world processors that store the file on disk in some proprietary format. We say 
""unfortunately"" because this severely restricts your options to process the 
document automatically. However, you still have a couple of options:
Write macros. 
 
 Most sophisticated word processors now have a macr
o
language. With some effort you can program them to export tagged 
sections of your documents into the alternative forms you need. If 
programming at this level is too painful, you could always export the 
appropriate section into a standard format plain text file, and then use a 
tool such as Perl to convert this into the final forms.
Make the document subordinate. 
 
 Rather than have the documen
t
as the definitive source, use another representation. (In the database 
example, you might want to use the schema as the authoritative 
information.) Then write a tool that exports this information into a form 
that the document can import. Be careful, however. You need to ensure 
that this information is imported every time the document is printed, 
rather than just once when the document is created.
We can generate API-level documentation from source code using tools such as JavaDo
c
and DOC++ in a similar fashion. The model is the source code: one view of the model ca
n
be compiled; other views are meant to be printed out or viewed on the Web. Our goal i
s
always to work on the model—whether the model is the code itself or some othe
r
document—and have all views updated automatically (see
 
Ubiquitous Automation
, for 
more on automatic processes).
Suddenly, documentation isn't so bad.
Technical Writers
Up until now, we've talked only about internal documentation—written by the programmer
s
themselves. But what happens when you have professional technical writers involved in th
e
project? All too often, programmers just throw material ""over the wall"" to technical writer
s
 and let them fend for themselves to produce user manuals, promotional pieces, and so on
.
This is a mistake. Just because programmers aren't writing these documents doesn't mea
n
that we can forsake pragmatic principles. We want the writers to embrace the same basi
c
principles that a Pragmatic Programmer does—especially honoring the
 
DRY
 principle, 
orthogonality, the model-view concept, and the use of automation and scripting.
Print It or Weave It
One problem inherent with published, paper documentation is that it can become out of 
date as soon as it's printed. Documentation of any form is just a snapshot.
So we try to produce all documentation in a form that can be published online, on the Web, 
complete with hyperlinks. It's easier to keep this view of the documentation up to date than 
to track down every existing paper copy, burn it, and reprint and redistribute new copies. 
It's also a better way to address the needs of a wide audience. Remember, though, to put 
a date stamp or version number on each Web page. This way the reader can get a good 
idea of what's up to date, what's changed recently, and what hasn't.
Many times you need to present the same documentation in different formats: a printed 
document, Web pages, online help, or perhaps a slide show. The typical solution relies 
heavily on cut-and-paste, creating a number of new independent documents from the 
original. This is a bad idea: a document's presentation should be independent of its 
content.
If you are using a markup system, you have the flexibility to implement as many different 
output formats as you need. You can choose to have
                                       
 
    <H1>
Chapter Title
</H1>
generate a new chapter in the report version of the document and title a new slide in the 
slide show. Technologies such as XSL and CSS
[11]
 can be used to generate multiple outpu
t
formats from this one markup.
[11]
 eXtensible Style Language and Cascading Style Sheets, two technologies designed to help separat
e
presentation from content.
If you are using a word processor, you'll probably have similar capabilities. If you 
remembered to use styles to identify different document elements, then by applying 
 different style sheets you can drastically alter the look of the final output. Most word 
processors now allow you to convert your document to formats such as HTML for Web 
publishing.
Markup Languages
Finally, for large-scale documentation projects, we recommend looking at some of the 
more modern schemes for marking up documentation.
Many technical authors now use DocBook to define their documents. DocBook is an 
SGML-based markup standard that carefully identifies every component in a document. 
The document can be passed through a DSSSL processor to render it into any number of 
different formats. The Linux documentation project uses DocBook to publish information in 
RTF, 
, info, PostScript, and HTML formats.
As long as your original markup is rich enough to express all the concepts you nee
d
(including hyperlinks), translation to any other pub-lishable form can be both easy an
d
automatic. You can produce online help, published manuals, product highlights for the We
b
site, and even a tip-a-day calendar, all from the same source—which of course is unde
r
source control and is built along with the nightly build (see
 
Ubiquitous Automation
).
Documentation and code are different views of the same underlying model, but the view is 
all
 that should be different. Don't let documentation become a second-class citizen, 
banished from the main project workflow. Treat documentation with the same care you 
treat code, and the users (and maintainers who follow) will sing your praises.

Did you write an explanatory comment for the source code you just wrote? Wh
y
not? Pressed for time? Not sure if the code will really work—are you just trying ou
t
an idea as a prototype? You'll throw the code away afterwards, right? It won't mak
e
it into the project uncommented and experimental, will it
?
Sometimes it is uncomfortable to document the design of source code because the 
design isn't clear in your mind; it's still evolving. You don't feel that you should

Great Expectations
Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid
…
Jeremiah 2:12
A company announces record profits, and its share price drops 20%. The financial new
s
that night explains that the company failed to meet analysts' expectations. A child opens a
n
expensive Christmas present and bursts into tears—it wasn't the cheap doll the child wa
s
hoping for. A project team works miracles to implement a phenomenally comple
x
application, only to have it shunned by its users because it doesn't have a help system
.
In an abstract sense, an application is successful if it correctly implements its 
specifications. Unfortunately, this pays only abstract bills.
In reality, the success of a project is measured by how well it meets the 
expectations
 of its 
users. A project that falls below their expectations is deemed a failure, no matter how good 
the deliverable is in absolute terms. However, like the parent of the child expecting the 
cheap doll, go too far and you'll be a failure, too.
Tip 69
Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations
However, the execution of this tip requires some work.
Communicating Expectations
Users initially come to you with some vision of what they want. It may be incomplete, 
inconsistent, or technically impossible, but it is 
theirs,
 and, like the child at Christmas, they 
have some emotion invested in it. You cannot just ignore it.
As your understanding of their needs develops, you'll find areas where their expectations 
cannot be met, or where their expectations are perhaps too conservative. Part of your role 
 is to communicate this. Work with your users so that their understanding of what you'll be 
delivering is accurate. And do this throughout the development process. Never lose sight of 
the business problems your application is intended to solve.
Some consultants call this process ""managing expectations""—actively controlling wha
t
users should hope to get from their systems. We think this is a somewhat elitist position
.
Our role is not to control the hopes of our users. Instead, we need to work with them t
o
come to a common understanding of the development process and the final deliverable
,
along with those expectations they have not yet verbalized. If the team is communicatin
g
fluently with the outside world, this process is almost automatic; everyone shoul
d
understand what's expected and how it will be built
.
There are some important techniques that can be used to facilitate this process. Of these, 
Tracer Bullets
, and 
Prototypes and Post-it Notes
, are the most important. Both let the team 
construct something that the user can see. Both are ideal ways of communicating your 
understanding of their requirements. And both let you and your users practice 
communicating with each other.
The Extra Mile
If you work closely with your users, sharing their expectations and communicating what 
you're doing, then there will be few surprises when the project gets delivered.
This is a 
BAD THING.
 Try to surprise your users. Not scare them, mind you, but 
delight
them.
Give them that little bit more than they were expecting. The extra bit of effort it requires to 
add some user-oriented feature to the system will pay for itself time and time again in 
goodwill.
Listen to your users as the project progresses for clues about what features would really 
delight them. Some things you can add relatively easily that look good to the average user 
include:
Balloon or ToolTip help
Keyboard shortcuts
A quick reference guide as a supplement to the user's manual
 Colorization
Log file analyzers
Automated installation
Tools for checking the integrity of the system
The ability to run multiple versions of the system for training
A splash screen customized for their organization
All of these things are relatively superficial, and don't really overburden the system with 
feature bloat. However, each tells your users that the development team cared about 
producing a great system, one that was intended for real use. Just remember not to break 
the system adding these new features.

The Requirements Pit
Challenges
Sometimes the toughest critics of a project are the people who worked on it. Have 
you ever experienced disappointment that your own expectations weren't met by 
something you produced? How could that be? Maybe there's more than logic at 
work here.
What do your users comment on when you deliver software? Is their attention to 
the various areas of the application proportional to the effort you invested in each? 
What delights them?

Pride and Prejudice
You have delighted us long enough.
Jane Austen, 
Pride and Prejudice
Pragmatic Programmers don't shirk from responsibility. Instead, we rejoice in accepting 
challenges and in making our expertise well known. If we are responsible for a design, or a 
piece of code, we do a job we can be proud of.
Tip 70
Sign Your Work
Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too.
Project teams are still made up of people, however, and this rule can cause trouble. On 
some projects, the idea of 
code ownership
 can cause cooperation problems. People may 
become territorial, or unwilling to work on common foundation elements. The project may 
end up like a bunch of insular little fiefdoms. You become prejudiced in favor of your code 
and against your coworkers.
That's not what we want. You shouldn't jealously defend your code against interlopers; by 
the same token, you should treat other people's code with respect. The Golden Rule (""Do 
unto others as you would have them do unto you"") and a foundation of mutual respect 
among the developers is critical to make this tip work.
Anonymity, especially on large projects, can provide a breeding ground for sloppiness, 
mistakes, sloth, and bad code. It becomes too easy to see yourself as just a cog in the 
wheel, producing lame excuses in endless status reports instead of good code.
While code must be owned, it doesn't have to be owned by an individual. In fact, Kent 
Beck's successful eXtreme Programming method [
URL 45
] recommends communal 
ownership of code (but this also requires additional practices, such as pair programming, to 
 guard against the dangers of anonymity).
We want to see pride of ownership. ""I wrote this, and I stand behind my work."" Your 
signature should come to be recognized as an indicator of quality. People should see your 
name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well written, tested, and documented. A 
really professional job. Written by a real professional.

Appendix A. Resource
s
The only reason we were able to cover so much ground in this book is that we viewed 
many of our subjects from a high altitude. If we'd given them the in-depth coverage they 
deserved, the book would have been ten times longer.
We started the book with the suggestion that Pragmatic Programmers should always be 
learning. In this appendix we've listed resources that may help you with this process.
In the section 
Professional Societies
, we give details of the IEEE and the ACM. We 
recommend that Pragmatic Programmers join one (or both) of these societies. Then, in 
Building a Library,
 we highlight periodicals, books, and Web sites that we feel contain 
high-quality and pertinent information (or that are just plain fun).
Throughout the book we referenced many software resources accessible via the Internet. 
In the 
Internet Resources
 section, we list the URLs of these resources, along with a short 
description of each. However, the nature of the Web means that many of these links may 
well be stale by the time you read this book. You could try one of the many search engines 
for a more up-to-date link, or visit our Web site at 
www.pragmaticprogrammer.com
 and 
check our links section.
Finally, this appendix contains the book's bibliography.

Professional Societies
There are two world-class professional societies for programmers: the Association for 
Computing Machinery (ACM)
[1]
 and the IEEE Computer Society
.
[2]
 We recommend that al
l
programmers belong to one (or both) of these societies. In addition, developers outside the 
United States may want to join their national societies, such as the BCS in the United 
Kingdom.

Membership in a professional society has many benefits. The conferences and local 
meetings give you great opportunities to meet people with similar interests, and the special 
interest groups and technical committees give you the opportunity to participate in setting 
standards and guidelines used around the world. You'll also get a lot out of their 
publications, from high-level discussions of industry practice to low-level computing theory.

Building a Library
We're big on reading. As we noted in 
Your Knowledge Portfolio
, a good programmer is 
always learning. Keeping current with books and periodicals can help. Here are some that 
we like.
Periodicals
If you're like us, you'll save old magazines and periodicals until they're piled high enough to 
turn the bottom ones to flat sheets of diamond. This means it's worth being fairly selective. 
Here are a few periodicals we read.
IEEE Computer. 
 
 Sent to members of the IEEE Computer Society,
 
Computer
has a practical focus but is not afraid of theory. Some issues are oriented around a 
theme, while others are simply collections of interesting articles. This magazine has 
a good signal-to-noise ratio
.
IEEE Software. 
 
 This is another great bimonthly publication of the IEEE Compute
r
Society aimed at software practitioners
.
Communications of the ACM. 
 
 The basic magazine received by all members o
f
the ACM, 
CACM
 has been a standard in the industry for decades, and has 
probably published more seminal articles than any other source
.
SIGPLAN. 
 
 Produced by the ACM Special Interest Group on Programmin
g
Languages, 
SIGPLAN
 is an optional addition to your ACM membership. It is often 
used for publishing language specifications, along with articles of interest to 
everyone who likes looking deeply into programming
.
Dr. Dobbs Journal. 
 
 A monthly magazine, available by subscription and o
n
newsstands, 
Dr. Dobbs
 is quirky, but has articles ranging from bit-level practice to 
heavy theory
.
The Perl Journal. 
 
 If you like Perl, you should probably subscribe to
 
The Perl 
Journal
 (
www.tpj.com
)
.
Software Development Magazine. 
 
 A monthly magazine focusing on genera
l
 issues of project management and software development
.
Weekly Trade Papers
There are several weekly newspapers published for developers and their managers. Thes
e
papers are largely a collection of company press releases, redressed as articles. However
,
the content is still valuable—it lets you track what is going on, keep abreast of new produc
t
announcements, and follow industry alliances as they are forged and broken. Don't expec
t
a lot of in-depth technical coverage, though
.
Books
Computing books can be expensive, but choose carefully and they're a worthwhile 
investment. Here are a handful of the many we like.
Analysis and Design
Object-Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition. 
 
 Bertrand Meyer's epi
c
book on the fundamentals of object-oriented development, all in about 1,300 pages 
[
Mey97b
]
.
Design Patterns. 
 
 A design pattern describes a way to solve a particular class o
f
problems at a higher level than a programming language idiom. This now-classic 
book [
GHJV95
] by the 
Gang of Four
 describes 23 basic design patterns, including 
Proxy, Visitor, and Singleton
.
Analysis Patterns. 
 
 A treasure trove of high-level, architectural patterns take
n
from a wide variety of real-world projects and distilled in book form. A relatively 
quick way to gain the insight of many years of modeling experience [
Fow96
]
.
Teams and Projects
The Mythical Man Month. 
 
 Fred Brooks' classic on the perils of organizin
g
project teams, recently updated [
Bro95
]
.
Dynamics of Software Development. 
 
 A series of short essays on buildin
g
software in large teams, focusing on the dynamics between team members, and 
between the team and the rest of the world [
McC95
]
.
 Surviving Object-Oriented Projects: A Manager's Guide. 
 
 Alistai
r
Cockburn's ""reports from the trenches"" illustrate many of the perils and pitfalls o
f
managing an OO project— especially your first one. Mr. Cockburn provides tip
s
and techniques to get you through the most common problems 
[
Coc97b
]
.
Specific Environments
Unix. 
 
 W. Richard Stevens has several excellent books including
 
Advanced 
Programming in the Unix Environment
 and the 
Unix Network Programming 
books
 [
Ste92
, 
Ste98
,

Windows. 
 
 Marshall Brain's
 
Win32 System Services
 [

Editors
Emacs and vi are not the only cross-platform editors, but they are freely available and 
widely used. A quick scan through a magazine such as 
Dr. Dobbs
 will turn up several 
commercial alternatives.
Emacs
Both Emacs and XEmacs are available on Unix and Windows platforms.
[URL l] The Emacs Editor
www.gnu.org
The ultimate in big editors, containing every feature that any editor has eve
r
had, Emacs has a near-vertical learning curve, but repays handsomel
y
once you've mastered it. It also makes a great mall and news reader
,
address book, calendar and diary, adventure game, …
.
[URL 2] The XEmacs Editor
www.xemacs.org
Spawned from the original Emacs some years ago, XEmacs is reputed to 
have cleaner internals and a better-looking interface.
vi
 There are at least 15 different vi clones available. Of these, 
vim
 is probably ported to the 
most platforms, and so would be a good choice of editor if you find yourself working in 
many different environments.
[URL 3] The Vim Editor
ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/misc/editors/vim
From the documentation: ""There are a lot of enhancements above vi: mult
i
level undo, multi windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command lin
e
editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc….
""
[URL 4] The elvis Editor
www.fh-wedel.de/elvis
An enhanced vi clone with support for X.
[URL 5] Emacs Viper Mode
http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~kifer/emacs.html
Viper is a set of macros that make Emacs look like vi. Some may doubt the 
wisdom of taking the world's largest editor and extending it to emulate an 
editor whose strength is its compactness. Others claim it combines the best 
of both worlds.
Compilers, Languages, and Development Tools
[URL 6] The GNU C/C++ Compiler
www.fsf.org/software/gcc/gcc.html
One of the most popular C and C++ compilers on the planet. It also does 
Objective-C. (At the time of writing, the egcs project, which previously 
splintered from gcc, is in the process of merging back into the fold.)
 [URL 7] The Java Language from Sun
java.sun.com
Home of Java, including downloadable SDKs, documentation, tutorials, 
news, and more.

sells a commercial Eiffel compiler and related tools.
[URL 12] Sather
www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~sather
Sather is an experimental language that grew out of Eiffel. It aims to support 
higher-order functions and iteration abstraction as well as Common Lisp, 
CLU, or Scheme, and to be as efficient as C, C++, or Fortran.
[URL 13] VisualWorks
www.objectshare.com
Home of the VisualWorks Smalltalk environment. Noncommercial versions 
for Windows and Linux are available for free.
[URL 14] The Squeak Language Environment
squeak.cs.uiuc.edu
Squeak is a freely available, portable implementation of Smalltalk-80 written 
in itself; it can produce C code output for higher performance.
[URL 15] The TOM Programming Language
www.gerbil.org/tom
A very dynamic language with roots in Objective-C.
 [URL 16] The Beowulf Project
www.beowulf.org
A project that builds high-performance computers out of networked clusters 
of inexpensive Linux boxes.
[URL 17] iContract—Design by Contract Tool for Jav
a
www.reliable-systems.com

Exercise 
1:
from
 
Orthogonality
You are writing a class called 
Split,
 which splits input lines into fields. Which of the following 
two Java class signatures is the more orthogonal design?
                                               
 
   
class
 Splitl {
     
public
 Splitl(InputStreamReader rdr) { ...
     
public void
 readNextLine() 
throws
 IOException { ...
     
public int
 numFields() { ...
     
public
 String getField(
int
 fieldNo) { ...
   }
   
class
 Split2 {
     
public
 Split2(String line) { ...
     
public int
 numFields() { ...
     
public
 String getField(
int
 fieldNo) { ...
   }
Answer 
1:
To our way of thinking, class 
Split2
 is more orthogonal. It concentrates on its own task, splitting 
lines, and ignores details such as where the lines are coming from. Not only does this make the 
code easier to develop, but it also makes it more flexible. 
Split2
 can split lines read from a file, 
generated by another routine, or passed in via the environment
 .
Exercise 
2:
from
 
Orthogonality
Which will lead to a more orthogonal design: modeless or modal dialog boxes?
Answer 
2:
If done correctly, probably modeless. A system that uses modeless dialog boxes will be les
s
concerned with what is going on at any particular moment in time. It will likely have a bette
r
intermodule communications infrastructure than a modal system, which may have built-i
n
assumptions about the state of the system?assumptions that lead to increased coupling an
d
decreased orthogonalit
y
.
 Exercise 
3:
from
 
Orthogonality
How about procedural languages versus object technology? Which results in a more 
orthogonal system?
Answer 
3:
This is a little tricky. Object technology 
can
 provide a more orthogonal system, but because it has 
more features to abuse, it is actually easier to create a 
nonorthogonal
 system using objects than it 
is using a procedural language. Features such as multiple inheritance, exceptions, operator 
overloading, and parent-method overriding (via subclassing) provide ample opportunity to increase 
coupling in nonobvious ways
 .
With object technology and a little extra effort, you can achieve a much more orthogona
l
system. But while you can always write ""spaghetti code"" in a procedural language, 
object-oriented languages used poorly can add meatballs to your spaghetti.

Prototypes and Post-it Notes
Marketing would like to sit down and brainstorm a few Web-page designs with you. The
y
are thinking of clickable image maps to take you to other pages, and so on. But they can'
t
decide on a model for the image—maybe it's a car, or a phone, or a house. You have a lis
t
of target pages and content; they'd like to see a few prototypes. Oh, by the way, you hav
e
15 minutes. What tools might you use
?
Answer 
4:
Low-tech to the rescue! Draw a few cartoons with markers on a whiteboard?a car, a phone, and 
a
house. It doesn't have to be great art; stick-figure outlines are fine. Put Post-it notes that describ
e
the contents of target pages on the clickable areas. As the meeting progresses, you can refine th
e
drawings and placements of the Post-it note
s
.

We want to implement a mini-language to control a simple drawing package (perhaps a 
turtle-graphics system). The language consists of single-letter commands. Some 
commands are followed by a single number. For example, the following input would draw a 
rectangle.
                                               
 
    P 2  # 
select pen 2
    D    # 
pen down
    W 2  # 
draw west 2cm
     N 1  # 
then north 1
    E 2  # 
then east 2
    S 1  # 
then back south
    U    # 
pen up
                                               
 
Implement the code that parses this language. It should be designed so that it is simple to 
add new commands.
 Answer 
5:
Because we want to make the language extendable, we'll make the parser table driven. Each entry 
in the table contains the command letter, a flag to say whether an argument is required, and the 
name of the routine to call to handle that particular command
.
                                               
 
   
typedef struct
 {
     
char
 cmd;               /* 
the command letter */
     
int
 hasArg;             /* 
does it take an argument */
     
void
 (*func)(
int, int
); /* 
routine to call */
   } Command;
   
static
 Command cmds[] = {
     { 'P',  ARG,     doSelectPen },
     { 'U',  NO_ARG,  doPenUp },
     { 'D',  NO_ARG,  doPenDown },
     { 'N',  ARG,     doPenDir },
     { 'E',  ARG,     doPenDir },
     { 'S',  ARG,     doPenDir },
     { 'W',  ARG,     doPenDir }
   };
The main program is pretty simple: read a line, look up the command, get the argument i
f
required, then call the handler function.
                                               
 
   
while
 (fgets (buff, 
sizeof
(buff), stdin)) {
     Command *cmd = findCommand(*buff);
     
if
 (cmd) {
       
int
 arg = 0 ;
       
if
 (cmd->hasArg && !getArg(buff+l, &arg)) {
         fprintf(stderr, ""
'%c' needs an argument\n
"", *buff);
         
continue;
       }
       cmd->func(*buff, arg);
    }
   }
The function that looks up a command performs a linear search of the table, returning eithe
r
the matching entry or 
NULL.
                                               
 
   Command *findCommand(
int
 cmd) {
     
int
 i;
     
for
 (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(cmds); i++) {
       
if
 (cmds[i].cmd == cmd)
          
return
 cmds + i;
     }
     fprintf (stderr, 
""Unknown command '%c'\n"",
 cmd);
     
return
 0;
   }
Finally, reading the numeric argument is pretty simple using
 
scanf.
                                               
 
   
int
 getArg(
const char
 *buff, 
int
 *result) {
     
return
 sscanf(buff, 
""%d"",
 result) == 1;
   }

You are asked ""Which has a higher bandwidth: a 1Mbps communications line or a person 
walking between two computers with a full 4GB tape in their pocket?"" What constraints will 
you put on your answer to ensure that the scope of your response is correct? (For example, 
you might say that the time taken to access the tape is ignored.)
Answer 
9:
Our answer must be couched in several assumptions
:
The tape contains the information we need to be transferred.
We know the speed at which the person walks.
We know the distance between the machines.
We are not accounting for the time it takes to transfer information to and from the 
tape.
The overhead of storing data on a tape is roughly equal to the overhead of sending it 
 over a communications line.
Exercise

Estimating
So, which has the higher bandwidth?
Answer 
10:
Subject to the caveats in 
Answer 9
: A 4GB tape contains 32 × 1
0
9
 bits, so a 1Mbps line 
would have to pump data for about 32,000 seconds, or roughly 9 hours, to transfer the 
equivalent amount of information. If the person is walking at a constant 3½ mph, then ou
r
two machines would need to be at least 31 miles apart for the communications line to 
outperform our courier. Otherwise, the person wins .

Halfway through writing this book, we realized that we hadn't put the 
use strict

many of our Perl examples. Write a script that goes through the

" in two 
languages of your choice. Try to make it easy to add new languages.
Answer 
13:
We use Perl to implement our solution. It dynamically loads a module to generate the requeste
d
language, so adding new languages is easy. The main routine loads the back end (based on 
a
command-line parameter), then reads its input and calls code generation routines based on th
e
content of each line. We're not particularly fussy about error handling?we'll get to know prett
y
quickly if things go wron
g
.
                                               
 
   
my
 $lang = 
shift or die
 
""Missing language"";
   $lang .=

     }
   }
Writing a language back end is simple: provide a module that implements the required si
x
entry points. Here's the C generator:
                                               
 
   #
!/usr/bin/perl -w

 CG;
   
use
 strict;
   # 
Code generator for 'C' (see cg_base.pl)
   
sub
 blankLine() { 
print
 
""\n"";
 }
   
sub
 comment()   { 
print
 
""/*$_[0] */\n"";
 }
   
sub
 startMsg()  { 
print
 
""typedef struct {\n"";
 }
   
sub
 endMsg()    { 
print
 
""
}
 $_[0];\n\n"";
 }
   
sub
 arrayType() {
     
my
 ($name, $type, $size) = @_;
     
print
 "" 
$type $name\
[
$size
]
;\n"";
    }
   
sub
 simpleType() {
     
my
 ($name, $type) = @_;
     
print
 ""  
$type $name;\n"";
   }
   1;
And here's the one for Pascal
:
                                               
 
   #!

 }
   
sub
 startMsg()  { 
print
 
""$_[0] = packed record\n"";
 }
   
sub
 endMsg()    { 
print
 
""end;\n\n"";
 }
   
sub
 arrayType() {
      my ($name, $type, $size) = @_;
     $size--;

Design by Contract
What makes a good contract? Anyone can add preconditions and postconditions, but will 
they do you any good? Worse yet, will they actually do more harm than good? For the 
example below and for those in Exercises 15 and 16, decide whether the specified contract 
is good, bad, or ugly, and explain why.
First, let's look at an Eiffel example. Here we have a routine for adding a 
STRING
 to a 
doubly linked, circular list (remember that preconditions are labeled with 
require,
 and 
postconditions with 
ensure
).
                                               
 
    -- 
Add an item to a doubly linked list,
    -- 
and return the newly created NODE.
    add_item (item : STRING) : NODE 
is
       
require
          item /= Void                  -- 
'/=' is 'not equal'.
          find_item(item) = Void        -- 
Must be unique
       
deferred                     
 -- 
Abstract base class.
       
ensure
          result.next.previous = result -- 
Cheek the newly
          result.previous.next = result -- 
added node's links.
          find_item(item) = result      -- 
Should find it.
       
end
                                               
 
Answer 
14:
This Eiffel example is 
good.
 We require non-null data to be passed in, and we guarantee that the 
semantics of a circular, doubly linked list are honored. It also helps to be able to find the string we 
stored. Because this is a deferred class, the actual class that implements it is free to use whatever 
underlying mechanism it wants to. It may choose to use pointers, or an array, or whatever; as long 
as it honors the contract, we don't care
 .
 Exercise

Design by Contract
Next, let's try an example in Java—somewhat similar to the example in Exercise 14
.
insertNumber
 inserts an integer into an ordered list. Pre- and postconditions are labeled as 
in iContract (see [
URL 17
]).
                                               
 
   
private int
 data[];
   /**
     * 
@post data[index-l] < data[index] &&
     
*       data[index] == aValue
     
*/
   
public
 Node insertNumber 
(final int
 aValue)
   {
     
int
 index = findPlaceToInsert(aValue);
     
...
                                               
 
Answer 
15:
This is 
bad.
 The math in the index clause (
index-1
) won't work on boundary conditions such as the 
first entry
 .
The postcondition assumes a particular implementation: we want contracts to be mor
e
abstract than that.
Exercise

Design by Contract
Here's a fragment from a stack class in Java. Is this a good contract?
                                               
 
    /**
      
* @pre anItem != null   // Require real data
      
* @post pop() == anItem // Verify that it's
      
*
                     
// on the stack
      
*/
    
public void
 push(
final
 String anItem)
Answer 
16:
It's a good contract, but a bad implementation. Here, the infamous ""Heisenbug"" [
URL 52
] rears its 
ugly
 head. The programmer probably just made a simple typo
—
pop
 instead of 
top.
 While 
this is a simple and contrived example, side effects in assertions (or in any unexpected 
place in the code) can be very difficult to diagnose .

" examples of DEC (as in Exercises 14–16) show an implementation of an AD
T
(Abstract Data Type)—typically a stack or queue. But not many people really write thes
e
kinds of low-level classes
.
So, for this exercise, design an interface to a kitchen blender. It will eventually be a 
Web-based, Internet-enabled, CORBA-fled blender, but for now we just need the interface 
to control it. It has ten speed settings (0 means off). You can't operate it empty, and you can 
change the speed only one unit at a time (that is, from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 2, not from 0 to 
2).
Here are the methods. Add appropriate pre- and postconditions and an invariant.
                                               
 
   
int
 getSpeed()
   
void
 setSpeed(
int
 x)
   
boolean
 isFull()
   
void
 fill()
   
void
 empty()
Answer 
17:
We'll show the function signatures in Java, with the pre- and postconditions labeled as in iContract
.
First, the invariant for the class
:
                                               
 
    /**
      
* @invariant getSpeed() > 0
      
*
      
implies isFull()              // Don't run empty
      
* @invariant getSpeed() >= 0 &&
      
*
      
getSpeed() < 10               // Range check
      
*/
                                               
 
Next, the pre- and postconditions
:
                                               
 
    /**
      
* @pre Math.abs(getSpeed() - x) <= 1 // Only change by one
      
* @pre x >= 0 && x < 10
            
// Range check
      
* @post getSpeed() == x
            
// Honor requested speed
      
*/
    
public void
 setSpeed(
final int
 x)
    /**
      * 
@pre !isFull
()                     
// Don't fill it twice
       
* @post isFull
()                     
// Ensure it was done
      
*/
    
void
 fill()
    /**
      * 
@pre isFull
()                      
// Don't empty it twice
      
* @post
 !
isFull()
                  
// Ensure it was done
      */
    
void
 empty()

 Operator overloading might have

When to Use Exceptions
While designing a new container class, you identify the following possible error conditions:
No memory available for a new element in the 
add
 routine
1
.
Requested entry not found in the 
fetch
 routine
2
.
null
 pointer passed to the add routine
3
.
 How should each be handled? Should an error be generated, should an exception be 
raised, or should the condition be ignored?
Answer 
21:
Running out of memory is an exceptional condition, so we feel that case (1) should raise an 
exception
.
Failure to find an entry is probably quite a normal occurrence. The application that calls ou
r
collection class may well write code that checks to see if an entry is present before adding 
a potential duplicate. We feel that case (2) should just return an error.
Case (3) is more problematic—if the value
 
null
 is significant to the application, then it may 
be justifiably added to the container. If, however, it makes no sense to store null values, an
exception should probably be thrown.

How to Balance Resources
Some C and C++ developers make a point of setting a pointer to 
NULL
 after they deallocate 
the memory it references. Why is this a good idea?
Answer 
22:
In most C and C++ implementations, there is no way of checking that a pointer actually points to 
valid memory. A common mistake is to deallocate a block of memory and reference that memory 
later in the program. By then, the memory pointed to may well have been reallocated to some 
other purpose. By setting the pointer to 
NULL,
 the programmers hope to prevent these ro","[0.0055987975, 0.027080908, 0.0140359225, 0.037061065, 0.051443815, 0.0071205944, -0.021998813, 0.0002165464, 0.011424094, 0.053114254, 0.12491476,

How to Balance Resources
Some Java developers make a point of setting an object variable to 
NULL
 after they have 
finished using the object. Why is this a good idea?
Answer 
23:
By setting the reference to 
NULL,
 you reduce the number of pointers to the referenced object by 
one. Once this count reaches zero, the object is eligible for garbage collection. Setting the 
references to 
NULL
 can be significant for long-running programs, where the programmers need to 
ensure that memory utilization doesn't increase over time
 .

Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
 We discussed the concept of physical decoupling in the box . Which of the following C++ 
header files is more tightly coupled to the rest of the system?
person1.h:
person2.h:
#include
""date.h""
class
 Personl {
private:
  Date myBirthdate;
public:
  Person1(Date &birthDate);
//...
class
 Date;
class
 Person2 {
private:
  Date *myBirthdate;
public:
  Person2(Date &birthDate);
  //...
Answer 
24:
A header file is supposed to define the interface between the corresponding implementation and 
the rest of the world. The header file itself has no need to know about the internals of the 
Date
class?it merely needs to tell the compiler that the constructor takes a
 
Date
 as a parameter. So, 
unless the header file uses 
Dates
 in inline functions, the second snippet will work fine
 .
What's wrong with the first snippet? On a small project, nothing, except that you ar
e
unnecessarily making everything that uses a 
Personl
 class also include the header file for 
Date.
 Once this kind of usage gets common in a project, you soon find that including on
e
header file ends up including most of the rest of the system—a serious drag on compilatio
n
times

Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
For the example below and for those in Exercises 26 and 27, determine if the method calls 
shown are allowed according to the Law of Demeter. This first one is in Java.
                                               
 
   
public void
 showBalance(BankAccount acct) {
     Money amt = acct. getBalance() ;
     printToScreen(amt .printFormat()) ;
   }
Answer 
25:
The variable 
acct
 is passed in as a parameter, so the 
getBalance
 call is allowed. Calling 
amt.printFormat(),
 however, is not. We don't ""own""
 
amt
 and it wasn't passed to us. We could 
eliminate 
showBalance's
 coupling to 
Money
 with something like this
 
:
                                               
 
   
void
 showBalance(BankAccount b) {
     b.printBalance();
   }

Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
This example is also in Java.

new
 Vector() ;
     }
     
private void
 doSomething() {
       myBlender.addlngredients(myStuff.elements());
     }
   }
Answer 
26:
Since 
Colada
 creates and owns both 
myBlender
 and 
myStuff,
 the calls to 
addIngredients
 and 
elements
 are allowed
 .

Decoupling and the Law of Demeter
This example is in C++.
                                               
 
   
void
 processTransaction(BankAccount acct, 
int
) {
     Person *who;
     Money amt;
     amt.setValue(123.45);
     acct.setBalance(amt);
     who = acct .getOwner() ;
     markWorkflow(who->name(), SET_BALANCE);
   }
Answer 
27:
In this case, 
processTransaction
 owns 
amt
?it is created on the stack,
 
acct
 is passed in, so both 
setValue
 and 
setBalance
 are allowed. But 
processTransaction
 does not own 
who,
 so the call 
who->name()
 is in violation. The Law of Demeter suggests replacing this line with
                                               
 
  markWorkflow(acct.name(), SET_BALANCE);
 The code in
 
processTransaction
 should not have to know which subobject within a 
BankAccount
 holds the name—this structural knowledge should not show throug
h
BankAccount's
 contract. Instead, we ask the 
BankAccount
 for the name on the account. It 
knows where it keeps the name (maybe in a 
Person,
 in a 
Business,
 or in a polymorphic 
Customer
 object).

Which of the following things would be better represented as code within a program, and 
which externally as metadata?
Communication port assignments

An editor's support for highlighting the syntax of various languages

.
An editor's support for different graphic devices
3

4

Answer 
28:
There are no definitive answers here?the questions were intended primarily to give you food fo
r
thought. However, this is what we thin
k
:
Communication port assignments. 
 
 Clearly, this information should be stored a
s
metadata. But to what level of detail? Some Windows communications programs let 
you select only baud rate and port (say 
COM1
 to 
COM4
). But perhaps you need to 
specify word size, parity, stop bits, and the duplex setting as well. Try to allow the 
finest level of detail where practical.
1
.
An editor's support for highlighting the syntax of various languages. 
 
 Thi
s
should be implemented as metadata. You wouldn't want to have to hack code just 
because the latest version of Java introduced a new keyword.
2
.
An editor's support for different graphic devices. 
 
 This would probably b
e
difficult to implement strictly as metadata. You would not want to burden your 
application with multiple device drivers only to select one at runtime. You could, 
however, use metadata to specify the name of the driver and dynamically load the 
code. This is another good argument for keeping the metadata in a human-readable 
format; if you use the program to set up a dysfunctional video driver, you may not be 
able to use the program to set it back.
3
.
A state machine for a parser or scanner. 
 
 This depends on what you are parsin
g
or scanning. If you are parsing some data that is rigidly defined by a standards body 
and is unlikely to change without an act of Congress, then hard coding it is fine. But 
if you are faced with a more volatile situation, it may be beneficial to define the state

It's Just a View
Suppose you have an airline reservation system that includes the concept of a flight:
                                               
 
   
public interface
 Flight {
     
// .Return false if flight full.
     
public boolean
 addPassenger(Passenger p);
     
public void
 addToWaitList(Passenger p);
     
public int
 getFlightCapacity();
     
public int
 getNumPassengers();
   }
If you add a passenger to the wait list, they'll be put on the flight automatically when an 
opening becomes available.
There's a massive reporting job that goes through looking for overbooked or full flights to 
suggest when additional flights might be scheduled. It works fine, but it takes hours to run.
We'd like to have a little more flexibility in processing wait-list passengers, and we've got t
o
do something about that big report—it takes too long to run. Use the ideas from this sectio
n
to redesign this interface
.
Answer 
29:
We'll take 
Flight
 and add some additional methods for maintaining two lists of listeners: one for 
wait-list notification, and the other for full-flight notification
 .
                                               
 
   
public interface
 Passenger {
     
public void
 waitListAvailable();
   }
   
public interface
 Flight {
     
...
     
public void
 addWaitListListener(Passenger p);
     
public void
 removeWaitListListener(Passenger p);
     
public void
 addFullListener(FullListener b);
     
public void
 removeFullListener(FullListener b);
     
...
     }
   
public interface
 BigReport 
extends
 FullListener {
     
public void
 FlightFullAlert(Flight f);
   }
If we try to add a
 
Passenger
 and fail because the flight is full, we can, optionally, put the 
Passenger
 on the wait list. When a spot opens up, 
waitList-Available
 will be called. This 
method can then choose to add the 
Passenger
 automatically, or have a service 
representative call the customer to ask if they are still interested, or whatever. We now have
the flexibility to perform different behaviors on a per-customer basis.
Next, we want to avoid having the
 
BigReport
 troll through tons of records looking for full 
flights. By having 
BigReport
 registered as a listener on 
Flights,
 each individual 
Flight
 ca
n
report when it is full—or nearly full, if we want. Now users can get live, up-to-the-minut
e
reports from
 
BigReport
 instantly, without waiting hours for it to run as it did previously.

Blackboards
For each of the following applications, would a blackboard system be appropriate or not? 
Why?
Image processing. 
 
 You'd like to have a number of parallel processes grab chunk
s
of an image, process them, and put the completed chunk back.
1
.
Group calendaring. 
 
 You've got people scattered across the globe, in different tim
e
zones, and speaking different languages, trying to schedule a meeting.
2
.
Network monitoring tool. 
 
 The system gathers performance statistics and collect
s
trouble reports. You'd like to implement some agents to use this information to look 
for trouble in the system.
3
.
Answer 
30:
Image processing. 
 
 For simple scheduling of a workload among the paralle
l
processes, a shared work queue may be more than adequate. You might want t
o
consider a blackboard system if there is feedback involved—that is, if the results o
f
one processed chunk affect other chunks, as in machine vision applications, o
r
complex 3D image-warp transforms
.
1
.
Group calendaring. 
 
 This might be a good fit. You can post scheduled meeting
s
and availability to the blackboard. You have entities functioning autonomously, 
feedback from decisions is important, and participants may come and go.
You might want to consider partitioning this kind of blackboard system depending on
who is searching: junior staff may care about only the immediate office, human 
resources may want only English-speaking offices worldwide, and the CEO may 
want the whole enchilada. There is also some flexibility on data formats: we are free 
2
.
 to ignore formats or languages we don't understand. We have to understand 
different formats only for those offices that have meetings with each other, and we 
do not need to expose all participants to a full transitive closure of all possible 
formats. This reduces coupling to where it is necessary, and does not constrain us 
artificially.
Network monitoring tool. 
 
 This is very similar to the mortgage/loan applicatio
n
program described. You've got trouble reports sent in by users and statistics 
reported automatically, all posting to the blackboard. A human or software agent can
analyze the blackboard to diagnose network failures: two errors on a line might just 
be cosmic rays, but 20,000 errors and you've got a hardware problem. Just as the 
detectives solve the murder mystery, you can have multiple entities analyzing and 
contributing ideas to solve the network problems.

Can you identify some coincidences in the following C code fragment? Assume that this 
code is buried deep in a library routine.
                                               
 
  fprintf (stderr, 
""Error, continue?""
);
  gets(buf);
Answer 
31:
There are several potential problems with this code. First, it assumes a 
tty
 environment. That may 
be fine if the assumption is true, but what if this code is called from a GUI environment where 
neither 
stderr
 nor 
stdin
 is open
 ?
Second, there is the problematic
 
gets,
 which will write as many characters as it receives 
into the buffer passed in. Malicious users have used this failing to create 
buffer overrun
security holes in many different systems. Never use 
gets().
Third, the code assumes the user understands English
.
Finally, no one in their right mind would ever bury user interaction such as this in a librar
y
routine.

Answer 
33:
It won't work in an applet context with security restrictions against writing to the local disk. Again, 
when you have a choice of running in GUI contexts or not, you may want to check dynamically to 
see what the current environment is like. In this case, you may want to put a log file somewhere 
other than the local disk if it isn't accessible
.

We have coded a set of simple sort routines, which can be downloaded from our Web site 
(
http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com
). Run them on various machines available to you. Do 
your figures follow the expected curves? What can you deduce about the relative speeds of 
your machines? What are the effects of various compiler optimization settings? Is the radix 
sort indeed linear?
Answer 
34:
Clearly, we can't give any absolute answers to this exercise. However, we can give you a couple of 
pointers
.
 If you find that your results don't follow a smooth curve, you might want to check to see i
f
some other activity is using some of your processor's power. You probably won't get good 
figures on a multiuser system, and even if you are the only user you may find that 
background processes periodically take cycles away from your programs. You might also 
want to check memory: if the application starts using swap space, performance will nose 
dive.
It is interesting to experiment with different compilers and different optimization settings. W
e
found some that pretty startling speed-ups were possible by enabling aggressive 
optimization. We also found that on the wider RISC architectures the manufacturer's 
compilers often outperformed the more portable GCC. Presumably, the manufacturer is 
privy to the secrets of efficient code generation on these machines.

Algorithm Speed
The routine below prints out the contents of a binary tree. Assuming the tree is balanced, 
roughly how much stack space will the routine use while printing a tree of 1,000,000 
elements? (Assume that subroutine calls impose no significant stack overhead.)
                                               
 
   
void
 printTree(
const
 Node *node) {
     
char
 buffer[1000];
     
if
 (node) {
       printTree(node->left);
        getNodeAsString(node, buffer);
        puts(buffer);
        printTree(node->right);
     }
   }
Answer 
35:
The 
printTree
 routine uses about 1,000 bytes of stack space for the 
buffer
 variable. It calls itself 
recursively to descend through the tree, and each nested call adds another 1,000 bytes to the 
stack. It also calls itself when it gets to the leaf nodes, but exits immediately when it discovers that 
the pointer passed in is 
NULL.
 If the depth of the tree is 
D,
 the maximum stack requirement is 
therefore roughly 1000 x 
(D +
 1)
 .
A balanced binary tree holds twice as many elements at each level. A tree of depth D hold
s
1 + 2+4+8 + … + 
2
D
–1
)
, or 2
D
–
1, elements. Our million-element tree will therefore need | 
lg(l,000,001) |, or 20 levels.
We'd therefore expect our routine to use roughly 21,000 bytes of stack
.

Can you see any way to reduce the stack requirements of the routine in Exercise 35 (apart 
from reducing the size of the buffer)?
Answer 
36:
A couple of optimizations come to mind. First, the 
printTree
 routine calls itself on leaf nodes, only 
to exit because there are no children. That call increases the maximum stack depth by about 1,000 
bytes. We can also eliminate the tail recursion (the second recursive call), although this won't affect 
the worst-case stack usage
 .
                                               
 
   
while
 (node) {
     
if
 (node->left) printTree(node->left);
     getNodeAsString(node, buffer);
     puts(buffer);
     node = node->right;
   }
The biggest gain, however, comes from allocating just a single buffer, shared by al
l
invocations of 
printTree.
 Pass this buffer as a parameter to the recursive calls, and only 
1,000 bytes will be allocated, regardless of the depth of recursion
.
                                               
 
   
void
 printTreePrivate(
const
 Node *node, 
char

if
 (node) {
        printTreePrivate(node->left, buffer);
        getNodeAsString(node, buffer);
        puts(buffer);
        printTreePrivate(node->right, buffer);
     }
   }

On page 180, we claimed that a binary chop is 
O
(
lg
(
n
))
.
 Can you prove this?
Answer 
37:
There are a couple of ways of getting there. One is to turn the problem on its head. If the array has 
 just one element, we don't iterate around the loop. Each additional iteration doubles the size of the 
array we can search. The general formula for the array size is therefore 
n
 = 2
m
,
 where 
m
 is the 
number of iterations. If you take logs to the base 2 of each side, you get lg(
n
) = lg(2
m
), which by the 
definition of logs becomes lg(
n
) = 
m.

Answer 
39:
When you see someone using enumerated types (or their equivalent in Java) to distinguish 
between variants of a type, you can often improve the code by subclassing
:
                                               
 
   
public class
 Shape {
     
private double
 size;
     
public
 Shape(
double
 size) {
       
this.
size = size;
     }
     
public double
 getSize() { 
return
 size; }
   }
    
public class
 Square 
extends
 Shape {
     
public
 Square(
double
 size) {
       
super
(size);
     }
     
public double
 area() {
       
double
 size = getSize() ;
       
return
 size*size;
     }
   }
   
public class
 Circle 
extends
 Shape {
     
public
 Circle(
double
 size) {
       
super(size);
     }
     
public double
 area() {
       
double
 size = getSize();
       
return
 Math.PI*size*size/4.0;
     }
   }
   // 
etc.

Refactoring
This Java code is part of a framework that will be used throughout your project. Refactor it 
to be more general and easier to extend in the future.
                                               
 
   
public class
 Window {
     
public
 Window(
int
 width, 
int
 height) { ... }
     
public void
 setSize(
int
 width, 
int
 height) { ... }
     
public boolean
 overlaps(Window w) { ... }
     
public int
 getArea() { . . . }
   }
Answer 
40:
This case is interesting. At first sight, it seems reasonable that a window should have a width and a 
height. However, consider the future. Let's imagine that we want to support arbitrarily shaped 
windows (which will be difficult if the 
Window
 class knows all about rectangles and their properties)
.
We'd suggest abstracting the shape of the window out of the
 
Window
 class itself.
                                               
 
   
public abstract class
 Shape {
     // ...
      
public abstract boolean
 overlaps(Shape s);
     
public abstract int
 getArea();
   }
   
public class
 Window {
     
private
 Shape shape;
     
public
 Window(Shape shape) {
       
this.
shape = shape;
       
...
     }
     
public void
 setShape(Shape shape) {
       
this.
shape = shape;
       
...
     }
     
public boolean
 overlaps(Window w) {
       
return
 shape.overlaps(w.shape);
     }
     
public int
 getArea() {
       
return
 shape.getArea();
     }
   }
Note that in this approach we've used delegation rather than subclassing: a window is not 
a
""kind-of'' shape—a window ""has-a"" shape. It uses a shape to do its job. You'll often fin
d
delegation useful when refactoring
.
We could also have extended this example by introducing a Java interface that specifie
d
the methods a class must support to support the shape functions. This is a good idea. It 
means that when you extend the concept of a shape, the compiler will warn you about 
classes that you have affected. We recommend using interfaces this way when you 
delegate all the functions of some other class.

Code That's Easy to Test
Design a test jig for the blender interface described in the answer to Exercise 17. Write a 
shell script that will perform a regression test for the blender. You need to test basic 
functionality, error and boundary conditions, and any contractual obligations. What 
restrictions are placed on changing the speed? Are they being honored?
Answer 
41:
First, we'll add a 
main
 to act 
as a
 unit test driver. It will accept a very small, simple language as an 
argument: ""E"" to empty the blender, ""F"" to fill it, digits 0-9 to set the speed, and so on
 .
                                                
 
   
public static void
 main(String args[]) {
     // 
Create the blender to test
     dbc_ex blender = 
new
 dbc_ex();
     // 
And test it according to the string on standard input
     
try
 {
       
int
 a;
       
char
 c;
       
while
 ((a = System.in.read()) != -1) {
         c = (
char
)a;
         
if
 (Character.isWhitespace(c)) {
           
continue;
         }
         
if
 (Character.isDigit(c)) {
           blender.setSpeed(Character.digit(c, 10));
         }
         
else
 {
           
switch
 (c) {
             
case
 'F': blender.fill();
                       
break;
             
case
 'E': blender.empty();
                       
break;
             
case
 's': System.out.println(
""SPEED: ""
 +
                                          blender.getSpeed());
                       
break;
             
case
 'f': System out.println(
""FULL ""
 +
                                          blender. isFull());
                       
break;
             default: throw 
new
 RuntimeException(
                       
""Unknown Test directive""
);
           }
         }
       }
     }
     
catch
 (java.io.IOException e) {
       System.err.println(
""Test jig failed: ""
 + e.getMessage());
     }
     System.err .println(
""Completed blending
\n"");
     System.exit(0);
   }
Next comes the shell script to drive the tests
.
                                                
 
   
#!/bin/sh
   CMD=

   expect_okay() {

The tests check to see if illegal speed changes are detected, if you try to empty the blende
r
while running, and so on. We put this in the makefile so we can compile and run the 
regression test by simply typing
                                                
 
   % make
   % make 
test
                                               
 
Note that we have the test exit with
 
0
 or 
1
 so we can use this as part of a larger test as well.
There was nothing in the requirements that spoke of driving this component via a script, o
r
even using a language. End users will never see it. But we have a powerful tool that we can
use to test our code, quickly and exhaustively.

The Requirements Pit
Which of the following are probably genuine requirements? Restate those that are not to 
make them more useful (if possible).
The response time must be less than 500 ms.
1
.
Dialog boxes will have a gray background.
2
.
The application will be organized as a number of front-end processes and a back-end 
server.
3
.
If a user enters non-numeric characters in a numeric field, the system will beep and 
not accept them.
4
.
The application code and data must fit within 256kB.
5
.
Answer 
42:
This statement sounds like a real requirement: there may be constraints placed on the 
application by its environment.
1
.
Even though this may be a corporate standard, it isn't a requirement. It would be better 
stated as ""The dialog background must be configurable by the end user. As shipped, 
the color will be gray."" Even better would be the broader statement ""All visual 
elements of the application (colors, fonts, and languages) must be configurable by the 
end user.""
2
.
This statement is not a requirement, it's architecture. When faced with something like 
this, you have to dig deep to find out what the user is thinking.
3
.
The underlying requirement is probably something closer to ""The system will prevent 
the user from making invalid entries in fields, and will warn the user when these 
entries are made.""
4
.
 This statement is probably a hard requirement.
5
.
