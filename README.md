# Virginia Tech Assignments

This repository includes a selection of coursework and projects I completed while studying computer science at Virginia Tech. The work covers topics like object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, Android app development, and general software engineering principles.

Each folder is organized by course or topic, with clear code and documentation where applicable. These projects reflect my ability to write clean, reliable code, follow technical requirements, and build practical solutions under academic deadlines.
